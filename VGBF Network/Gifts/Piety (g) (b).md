## As a gift
Piety (Pietas) (g): a disposition whereby “we are moved to regard other persons as God regards them, namely as potential or actual children [of God], and thereby our brothers and sisters” (_Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit_, screen 8).  
$\qquad$”to give worship to God as one’s *Father* \[which is the specific rationale of piety] is still more excellent than giving worship to God as one’s creator and Lord \[which is the specific rationale of [religion](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Justice%2FReligion%20(vd))].”

"Justice in the Christian life of grace …has a different form to that of piety in the classical pagan world” (_Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance_, p. 26).  

Note the story of Uzzah’s death in 2 Samuel 6:2-7, for touching the Ark in order to steady it. “[T]he fate of Uzzah teaches us a lesson about the care that we need in dealing with the concretely given supernatural, namely with God and the things of God that are hallowed for our salvation. Uzzah violated what we would today call the disposition of _piety_, connected with justice, and we need to be careful not to repeat his offence, whether or not God strikes us dead. A contemporary application of the story of Uzzah is the reverence we should have towards the tabernacle, used to reserve the body of Christ under the form of the Eucharistic hosts, prefigured by the Ark of the Covenant. We should not be over-familiar and should have a proper reverence towards the tabernacle in church, for example by genuflecting. We should also approach the sanctuary of God’s churches with proper reverence and awe. That is one contemporary example of the spiritual gift of piety, linked to the Christian cardinal virtue of justice.” (_Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance_, p. 30.)  

”As supernaturalised human beings, a similar lesson applies to the reverence due to the adopted children of God”, e.g. ‘for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me. (Matthew 25:31-40)’ (_Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance_, p. 30-31).  

## As a beatitude
Blessed are the [[Meekness (vm) (b) (f)|meek]]…
The second beatitude.
In this case, there is only a weak connection between piety and meekness. Firstly, Aquinas has to advert to the mere formalism of the places of the second beatitude and the second last gift. Secondly, he qualifies this particular linkage by writing that while “one has to match the beatitudes with the gifts in accord with their objects and acts. And in this sense the fourth and fifth beatitudes correspond to piety more than the second beatitude does. Still, the second beatitude has some similarity to piety, viz., insofar as impediments to the acts of piety are removed by mildness.” (Part 2-2, q121, a2, response)
$\qquad$As a result, Aquinas accommodates the second beatitude by writing that “According to what is proper to the beatitudes and to the gifts, it is necessary for the same beatitude to be matched with both [knowledge (g)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FKnowledge%20(g)%20(b)) and piety.” (Part 2-2, q121, a2, response)

**Note tempering an overly linear connection between gifts and beatitudes**: “According to what is proper to the beatitudes and to the gifts, it is necessary for the same beatitude to be matched with both knowledge and piety. By contrast, according to the character of the \[Scriptural] ordering, diverse beatitudes should be matched with them—even though, as was said above, a certain sort of agreement is observed between them.” (Part 2-2, q121, a2, rep obj 2)

## Not a virtue
 “Distinct from the virtue of [piety (vm)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Justice%2FPiety%20(vm)) of the same name” (_Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance_, p. 28).
 $\qquad$”As was explained above (ST 1-2, q. 68 and q. 69, a. 1), the gifts of the Holy Spirit are certain habitual dispositions of the soul by which it is movable with promptitude by the Holy Spirit. Now among other things, the Holy Spirit moves us to having a certain sort of filial affection for God—this according to Romans 8:15 (“You have received the spirit of adoption which belongs to children and in which you cry out, ‘Abba, Father’”). And since piety properly involves giving worship and service to one’s father, it follows that the piety in accord with which we give worship and service to God as our Father through the inspiration (instinctus) of the Holy Spirit is a gift of the Holy Spirit. (Part 2-2, Q 121, a1. response)
 $\qquad$”The piety which gives worship and service to one’s carnal father is a virtue, whereas the piety which is a gift [of the Holy Spirt] gives these things to God.” (Part 2-2, Q 121, a1. repl to obj. 1)

**Connection of the gifts to the theological virtues:** “Now the first union a man has \[with the Holy Spirit] is through faith, hope, and charity. Hence, the gifts presuppose these virtues as the roots, so to speak, of the gifts. Hence, all the gifts have to do with these three virtues insofar as they are certain derivatives of these virtues.” (Part 1-2, q68, a4, rep obj 3)
$\qquad$’whoever has charity has all the gifts of the Holy Spirit, none of which can be had without charity.” (Part 1-2, q68, a5, resp)

**The connection of the gifts to the intellectual and moral virtues:** “it is clear that these gifts extend to everything that the virtues, both intellectual and moral, extend to.” (Part 1-2, q68, a4 resp)
$\qquad$“reason is speculative and practical, and in both speculative reason and practical reason there is (a) apprehension of truth, which pertains to discovery, and (b) judgment concerning truth. Thus, with respect to the apprehension of truth, speculative reason is perfected by *understanding* (g), whereas practical reason is perfected by [*counsel (g)*](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FCounsel%20(g)%20Mercy%20(b)%20(v)). And with respect to judging correctly, speculative reason is perfected by [*wisdom (g)*](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FWisdom%20(g)%20(vi)%20Peace%20(b)), whereas practical reason is perfected by [*knowledge (g)*](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FKnowledge%20(g)%20(b)) (cf. ST 2-2, q. 8, a. 6).” (Part 1-2, q68, a4 resp)
$\qquad$Thus:
		1. Speculative reason pertaining to discovery means [understanding (vi)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FUnderstanding%20(g)%20(b)%20(vi)%20(vm))
		2. Speculative reason pertaining to judging correctly means [wisdom (vi)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FIntellectual%20virtues%2FWisdom%20(vi))
		3. Practical reason pertaining to discovery means [prudence (vi)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FPrudence%20(vi))
		4. Practical reason pertaining to judging correctly means [scientific knowledge (vi)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FIntellectual%20virtues%2FScientific%20knowledge%20(vi))
“in those matters that have to do with others, the appetitive power is perfected by *piety (g)*, whereas in those matters that have to do with oneself, it is perfected by *fortitude (g)* in the face of the fearful dangers and by *fear (g)* in the face of a disordered desire for pleasant things” (Part 1-2, q68, a4 resp)
$\qquad$Thus, 
		5. “those matters that have to with others” refers to [[Justice (vm)|justice]]
		6.  “those matters that have to with oneself” … “in the face of fearful dangers” refers to [courage (vm)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FCourage%20(vm))
		7. “those matters that have to with oneself”… “in the face of a disordered desire for pleasant things” refers to [temperance (vm)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FTemperance%20(vm))

**Connection between the gifts:** ”Joined to understanding is wisdom, which directs it, and joined to fortitude is counsel, which directs it, and joined to piety is knowledge, which directs it. Therefore, some directive gift should be added to fear.” (Part 1-2, q68, a4, obj 5)
$\qquad$”two things are posited as corresponding to wisdom in its directive role—viz., the gift of understanding to direct the intellect and the gift of fear to direct the affections. For the notion of the fear of God is based principally on a consideration of God’s excellence, which is what wisdom considers.” (Part 1-2, q68, a4, repl obj 5)

”Appended to the virtue of justice” (_Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit_, screen 6).
	$\qquad$**On the connection between the two:** The name ‘justice’ is imposed because of the rectitude of reason, and this is why the name ‘virtue’ is more appropriate than the name ‘gift’. By contrast, the name ‘piety’ connotes the reverence that we have for our father and for our homeland. And as Augustine explains in *De Civitate Dei* 10, *since the father of all is God, the worship of God is likewise called ‘piety’. And so it is appropriate to give the name ‘piety’ to the gift by which one does good to everyone out of reverence for God.* (italics added) (Part 1-2, q68, a4, repl obj 2)


Connected to [[Meekness (vm) (b) (f)|meekness]] (see the section above on the beatitude).

“The fruits of the Holy Spirit generated by justice and piety are [[Goodness (f)|goodness]], [[Benignity (f)|benignity]] and [[Meekness (vm) (b) (f)|meekness]] (Ga 5:22-23)” (_Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance_, p. 26).  
$\qquad$”Among the fruits \[of the Holy Spirit], goodness and kindness can be attributed to piety directly, whereas mildness is attributed to piety indirectly, given that, as has been said, mildness removes impediments to the acts of piety” (Part 2-2, q121, a2, rep obj 3)

”The principal fruit of the Holy Spirit \[, borne by justice and piety,] that culminates \[the] transformation \[of the [[Courage (g) Righteousness (b)|fourth beatitude]]] is ‘[[Benignity (f)|benignity]]’” (_Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance_, p. 34).

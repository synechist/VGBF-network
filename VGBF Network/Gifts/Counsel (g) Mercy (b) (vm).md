	## As a gift
Counsel (*Consilium*) (g): a disposition whereby “we are ‘directed as though counselled by God,’ implying that we take on God’s stance toward possible courses of action” (_Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit_, screen 9).  
$\qquad$”[Prudence](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FPrudence%20(v)) or *euboulia*, whether acquired or infused, directs a man in the inquiry of deliberation in accord with what reason is able to comprehend. Hence, through prudence or *euboulia* a man comes to be good at deliberating for himself or for another. However, because human reason is unable to comprehend all the singular and contingent things that can occur (*non potest comprehendere singularia et contingentia quae occurre possunt*), it turns out that, as Wisdom 9:14 says, “the thoughts of mortals are timid, and our counsels are uncertain.” And so a man needs to be directed in the inquiry of deliberation by God, who comprehends all things. This occurs through the gift of counsel, through which a man is directed, as it were, by counsel that he receives from God—just as, in human affairs, those who are not sufficient unto themselves in the inquiry of deliberation likewise require counsel from those who are wiser. (Part 2-2, Q52, a1, rep to obj 2)

”we may be prompted in certain ways, by means of the spiritual gift of counsel, to take actions that we might not previously have considered and that are, by worldly standards, imprudent” (_Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance_, p. 20)  

**Distinction from habituated virtues:** ”children themselves can be prudential in ways that would have been unthinkable for the paragons of pagan virtue in the ancient worlds of Greece and Rome. In Christian teaching and experience, children in a state of grace literally have practical wisdom, not to make the decisions that are proper to adults, but to do the things that are truly needed, namely to stay close to what is holy and to reject what is unholy” (_Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance_, p. 20).

**Distinction from the gift of knowledge:** “Since the gift of knowledge exists in the speculative part of the soul, it does not directly correspond to prudence, but it does assist prudence by a certain extension. By contrast, the gift of counsel directly corresponds to prudence insofar as it has to do with the same things that prudence has to do with.” (Part 2-2, q52, a1, repl to obj 2)

## As a beatitude
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. 

**Motivation for mercy (b)’s corresponding to counsel (g):** counsel directly, that is, practically and via [prudence](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FPrudence%20(vi)), determines what is useful for reaching some end. Now amongst the beatitudes, only mercy is ordered, in the same direct and practical mode, to the overall good of another, that is, it involves [love (v)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FTheological%20Virtues%2FLove%20(v)) in general, not some more particular disposition. Therefore counsel directs, via prudence (and justice and temperance: see next section), acts of mercy so that its fruits perfect and terminate an act of love.
$\qquad$”In *De Sermone Domini in Monte* Augustine says, “Counsel befits the merciful, since forgiving others and giving to them is the only remedy for rooting out such great evils.” 
$\qquad$**I respond:** Counsel has to do, properly speaking, with what is useful for an end. Hence, what is especially useful for an end ought especially to correspond to the gift of counsel. But such is mercy—this according to 1 Timothy 4:8 (“Compassion (*pietas*) is useful for all things”). And so counsel corresponds to the beatitude concerning mercy, not in the sense that it elicits mercy, but in the sense that it directs mercy. 
$\qquad$**Reply to objection 1:** Even if counsel directs all acts of the virtues, it nonetheless especially directs the operations of charity, and for the reason already explained. 
$\qquad$**Reply to objection 2:** Insofar as counsel is a gift of the Holy Spirit, it directs us in all the things that are ordered toward the end of eternal life.”(Part 2-2, q52, a4, response)


## As a virtue
Mercy (v): ““Mercy or pity (*misericordia*) is compassion in our heart for another’s unhappiness (*alienae miseriae in nostro corde compassio*), by which we are compelled to help if we are able to.” For it is called ‘*misericordia*’ from the fact that one has a saddened heart (*miserum cor*) over the unhappiness of another (*super miseria alterius*).” (Part 2-2, q30, a1, response)

“Insofar as it is a virtue, mercy is a moral virtue that has to do with the passions, and it is traced back to the mean that is called *nemesis*, since it proceeds from the same moral disposition, as *Rhetoric 2* explains. To be sure, the Philosopher does posit these means as passions and not as virtues, since they are praiseworthy even insofar as they are passions. However, nothing prevents them from arising from an elective habit. And in this respect they assume the character of a virtue.”(Part 2-2, q30, a1, rep to obj 4)

Mercy (v) is an “effect of love,” borne out in acts of empathy such as the following: “defects are always the reason for having pity or mercy, either insofar as one thinks of another’s defect as his own because of a union of love, or because of the possibility of undergoing similar evils.” (Part 2-2, q30, a1, response)

### Why I am including the virtue of mercy alongside the beatitude and its correlated gift
**Mercy, even in discussions of its nature as a virtue, is not only a virtue:** “\[mercy] can, in one sense, denominate a movement of the **sentient appetite**. And on this score mercy or pity is a passion and not a virtue… However, in a second sense it can denominate a movement of the **intellective appetite**, insofar as an individual is displeased by what is bad for someone else. Now this movement can be regulated by reason and, in accord with this movement regulated by reason, the movement of the lower appetite can be regulated. Hence, in *De Civitate Dei* 9 Augustine says, “This movement of the soul”—viz., mercy—“serves reason when mercy is offered in such a way that justice is preserved, whether one is giving to the needy or forgiving the penitent.” And because, as was shown above (ST 1-2, q. 56, a. 4 and q. 59, a. 4 and q. 60, a. 5 and q. 66, a. 4), the nature of a human virtue consists in the mind’s movements being regulated by reason, it follows that mercy is a virtue.” (Part 2-2, q30, a3, response)
$\qquad$**I reason that** one possibility is that mercy is *only* either a sentient appetite and a virtue, while another possibility is that the same disposition is *also* a gift and a beatitude. The latter possibility is borne out by the facts that (a) mercy is not placed under any particular cardinal virtue, but rather under love, the originary virtue, bringing it closer to where the gifts are placed, and (b) that it is connected to several of them: mercy, in the preceding quotation from Aquinas, is explicitly connected to [just](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FJustice%20(v)) action. Moreover, insofar as it “serves reason” so as to offer an act of mercy “in such a way that…”, this connects to [prudence](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FPrudence%20(v)), that is, knowing the next step to take. Furthermore, insofar as mercy is “has to do with the passions” (Part 2-2, q30, a1, rep to obj 4), it connects to [temperance](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FTemperance%20(v)). As such, mercy appears to fall under at least three of the four cardinal virtues, although Aquinas does not place it under these virtues.
$\qquad$Now it is not apparent that, in function, mercy (v) is any closer to counsel (g) than other virtues like, say, revenge or respectfulness. For these are equally directly practical. However, I do not claim that mercy has a special place for this reason; rather, I claim that mercy (v) is *the same underlying disposition* as mercy (b), and so it is not a separate thing, and that mercy (b) uniquely shares a practical bent with counsel (g). And so the distinctions between them is in their acquiring accidents which qualify them in different ways: the beatitude is mercy as a measure of one’s stage of development in the ability to love, and the virtue is the disposition to act mercifully, while the associated gift (counsel) is the practically oriented gift by which one takes on God’s stance in practical matters, so it makes sense that mercy (b) is the beatitude ordered to practical action. 
$\qquad$What is worth asking is how mercy (v) is related to prudence (v). For (as noted in the Network section below), counsel connects to prudence, not mercy (v). Yet love (v) connects to counsel (g) connects to prudence (v) via mercy (b), which, however, implies directly taking merciful action and thus possessing its relevant disposition, mercy (v). So is mercy (v) an integral part of prudence? Not in Aquinas. 

In the light of the above, I tentatively identify the virtue of mercy with the homonymous beatitude and its correlated gift, counsel.
\[Probably do something different. I see a hinge or swing-like structure, with fruits and virtues on the one side, and gifts and beatitudes on the other. Rather separate this entry out into two entries. Don’t push too far.]

### Connection of the gifts to the theological virtues
“Now the first union a man has \[with the Holy Spirit] is through faith, hope, and charity. Hence, the gifts presuppose these virtues as the roots, so to speak, of the gifts. Hence, all the gifts have to do with these three virtues insofar as they are certain derivatives of these virtues.” (Part 1-2, q68, a4, rep obj 3)
$\qquad$’whoever has charity has all the gifts of the Holy Spirit, none of which can be had without charity.” (Part 1-2, q68, a5, resp)

### Connection between the gifts
 “the gift of [[Courage (g) Righteousness (b)|fortitude]] is directed by the gift of counsel, which seems to have to do mainly with the better goods.” (Part 2-2, q 139, a1, reply to objection 3)
 $\qquad$”Joined to understanding is wisdom, which directs it, and joined to fortitude is counsel, which directs it, and joined to piety is knowledge, which directs it. Therefore, some directive gift should be added to fear.” (Part 1-2, q68, a4, obj 5)
$\qquad$”two things are posited as corresponding to wisdom in its directive role—viz., the gift of understanding to direct the intellect and the gift of fear to direct the affections. For the notion of the fear of God is based principally on a consideration of God’s excellence, which is what wisdom considers.” (Part 1-2, q68, a4, repl obj 5)

### The connection of the gifts to the intellectual and moral virtues
“it is clear that these gifts extend to everything that the virtues, both intellectual and moral, extend to.” (Part 1-2, q68, a4 resp)
$\qquad$“reason is speculative and practical, and in both speculative reason and practical reason there is (a) apprehension of truth, which pertains to discovery, and (b) judgment concerning truth. Thus, with respect to the apprehension of truth, speculative reason is perfected by *understanding* (g), whereas practical reason is perfected by [*counsel (g)*](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FCounsel%20(g)%20Mercy%20(b)%20(v)). And with respect to judging correctly, speculative reason is perfected by [*wisdom (g)*](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FWisdom%20(g)%20(b)), whereas practical reason is perfected by [*knowledge (g)*](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FKnowledge%20(g)%20(b)) (cf. ST 2-2, q. 8, a. 6).” (Part 1-2, q68, a4 resp)
$\qquad$Thus:
		1. Speculative reason pertaining to discovery means [understanding (vi)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FUnderstanding%20(g)%20(b)%20(vi)%20(vm))
		2. Speculative reason pertaining to judging correctly means [wisdom (vi)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FWisdom%20(g)%20(vi)%20Peace%20(b))
		3. Practical reason pertaining to discovery means [[Prudence (vi)|prudence]]
		4. Practical reason pertaining to judging correctly means [scientific knowledge (vi)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FIntellectual%20virtues%2FScientific%20knowledge%20(vi))
“in those matters that have to do with others, the appetitive power is perfected by *piety (g)*, whereas in those matters that have to do with oneself, it is perfected by *fortitude (g)* in the face of the fearful dangers and by *fear (g)* in the face of a disordered desire for pleasant things” (Part 1-2, q68, a4 resp)
$\qquad$Thus, 
		5. “those matters that have to with others” refers to [justice (vm)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FJustice%20(vm))
		6.  “those matters that have to with oneself” … “in the face of fearful dangers” refers to [courage (vm)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FCourage%20(vm))
		7. “those matters that have to with oneself”… “in the face of a disordered desire for pleasant things” refers to [temperance (vm)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FTemperance%20(vm))

The gift of counsel is ”Appended to the virtue of prudence” (_Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit_, screen 6).
$\qquad$”the gift of counsel corresponds to prudence in the sense that it assists and perfects it.” (Part 2-2, Q52, a2, response)



### Connection of the gifts to the beatitudes
/
	1. Generic: 
		(a) The beatitudes are connected to [hope], since they are “micro-narratives” which link an undesirable state with a promised future state (*Faith, Hope and Love*, p. 50). 
		/
		(b) The beatitudes exhibit a shift from (i) more passive states, such as mourning and meekness, to more active states like exercising mercy and making peace; (ii) a shift from first-personal need (e.g. “poor in spirit”) to a focus on other persons and a “care and outpouring of love for other persons”. “The Christian life \[…] gradually becomes more ecstatic and outward-focused, as the exercise of the virtue of hope gradually enables and gives way to the practice of [divine love]” (*Faith, Hope and Love*, p. 51). 
		$\qquad$Thus **I infer** that the fifth beatitude connects to the [sixth beatitude, purity](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FUnderstanding%20(g)%20(vi)%20(vm)%20Purity%20(b)).
			/
	2. Specific
		(c) beatitudes are enumerated by (a) reference to the concupiscible and irascible parts of the soul and (b) their relation to the “three kinds of beatitude” which “various authors have posited” (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp). The first “kind” is a false kind of beatitude and is to be resisted, the second kind is to be strengthened, and the third shares in the essence of true beatitude and is thus a reward for the perfect of the second kind. Concerning the first kind, Aquinas relies in part on the gospel of Luke, which only gives four beatitudes, to account for the various kind of resistance to the pleasurable life:
>		*Luke reports that our Lord’s sermon was delivered to the crowds. Hence, he numbers the beatitudes in keeping with the capacity of the crowds, which knew only pleasurable and temporal and earthly beatitude. Hence, by the four beatitudes our Lord rules out the four things that seem to pertain to this sort of beatitude. The first is an abundance of exterior things, which he rules out by saying, “Blessed are the poor.” The second is a man’s being well off with respect to his body, in food and drink and other such things; and he rules this out in the second beatitude by saying, “Blessed are those who hunger.” The third is a man’s being well off with respect to hearty enjoyment (*cordis iucunditas*), *and he rules this out with the third beatitude by saying, “Blessed are they who are now mourning.” The fourth is external favor in the eyes of men, and he rules this out with the fourth beatitude by saying, “Blessed will you be when men hate you.”*

/
		The first, second, and third beatitudes “remove the obstacle posed by \[the first kind of beatitude, a false kind of beatitude,] the *pleasurable life*” (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp). “Blessed are the poor in spirit…” is thus read as a blessed deprivation of pleasure, referring either “to the contempt for riches or to the contempt for honours that results from humility” (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp). 
		$\qquad$“Blessed are those who mourn…” is read as not merely using concupiscible passions with moderation, as virtue directs, but if necessary, “wholly casting them aside… or even taking on a willful sorrow” (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp). The stance is one of almost flamboyant disregard due to a profound detachment, presumably due to a far greater and more beautiful love for (and from) God.
		$\qquad$ “Blessed are the meek…” is read as being “wholly undisturbed” by irascible passions as a result of the action of a gift (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp). The stance is one of complete insulation from the striving of irascible passions, due to the gift of piety by which “we are moved to regard other persons as God regards them, namely as potential or actual children [of God], and thereby our brothers and sisters” (_Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit_, screen 8).
		$\qquad$The fourth and fifth beatitudes strengthen us in the second kind of beatitude, the active life, which to Aquinas “consists principally in what we render to our neighbours, either as a debt or a spontaneous gift” (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp). “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst or justice…” thus surpasses the virtue of justice’s reasonable desire with a “fervent desire that we fulfil the works of justice” (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp). 
		$\qquad$”Blessed are the merciful…” is read as pertaining to the “spontaneous gift” clause above, and it surpasses the reasonable giving of gifts to “friends or others who are joined to us” in accordance with [liberality](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Justice%2FLiberality%20(vm)), by extending generosity further afield as per Luke 14:12-13: “When you fix a dinner or a supper, do not invite your friends or rothers… but invite the poor and the maimed.” This, Aquinas claims, is “properly speaking, to show mercy” (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp). Interestingly, the gift-driven generosity \[is it really mercy?] does *not* include friends or brothers, it leaves these to reason “out of reverence for God” (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp).
		$\qquad$The sixth and seventh beatitudes are *rewards*, that is, at least the beginning of a partaking in final beatitude, since the third kind of beatitude, the contemplative life, is thought to share in its essence (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp). Thus, the gift of understanding is how we grasp what is proposed to us by God, and “blessed are the pure of heart…” has *seeing God* as a reward for the cleansing of the heart through the second kind of beatitude.
		$\qquad$The gift of wisdom is right judgment on account of “connaturality” with supernatural things, due to “adoptive filiation” (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp). This, ”blessed are the peacemakers…” has *being a son of God* as an effect of the active life “by which a man is perfected in relation to his neighbour” (Part 1-2, q69, a3, repl obj 1). Aquinas cites Isaiah 32:17 – “the work of justice is peace” to establish this relation. So… *the gift of becoming a son of God is the reward for bringing one’s relations to neighbours to a state of peace.*
			/
	3. As for **how the promissory rewards within each beatitude are connected**, Aquinas, in responding to an objection that the rewards seem to be back-to-front, writes the following:
	
> 		*The rewards are likewise ordered to one another by addition. For it is more to possess the land (*terra*) *of the kingdom of heaven than simply to have the kingdom of heaven, since we have many things which we do not possess peacefully and with security. It is also more to be consoled in the kingdom than to have and possess the kingdom, since we possess many things with sorrow. Likewise, it is more to have one’s fill than simply to be consoled, since having one’s fill implies an abundance of consolation. Yet mercy exceeds having one’s fill, in the sense that a man receives more than he has merited or could desire. And it is still greater to see God, just as it is greater for someone not only to dine in the king’s court but also to see the king’s face. Moreover, the king’s son has the highest place in the royal household.* (Part 1-2, q69, a4, repl obj 3)


### All beatitudes are (perfect) fruits
Also: “all the beatitudes can be called fruits, but not *vice versa*.” Moreover, beatitudes are perfect fruits! -which, “by reason of their perfection, are attributed more to the gifts than to the virtues.” (Part 1-2, q70, a2 resp)

// makes me wonder whether *expression* of bodily desires, not just the exercise of *restraint*, also has its own set of fruits! 

### Connection to fruits
“A fruit implies something ultimate. However, in practical matters what is ultimate lies not in cognition but in operation, viz., the end. And so nothing pertaining to practical cognition is posited among the fruits; instead what is posited is that which belongs to the operations \[i.e. beatitudes] that practical cognition directs. Among these are [[Goodness (f)|goodness]] and [[Benignity (f)|kindness]], which correspond to mercy.” (Part 2-2, q52, a4, rep to obj 3)

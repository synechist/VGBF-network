## As a gift
Knowledge (Scientia) (g): “a ‘participated likeness’ (_participativa similitudo_) of God’s knowledge, knowledge that is absolute and simple rather than discursive, as \[with] the homonomous intellectual virtue”(_Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit_, screen 8).  

## As an intellectual virtue
Scientific knowledge (*Scientia*) (vi): the virtue that “perfects the intellect with respect to what is ultimate in this or that *genus* of knowable things,” (italics added) in contrast with [wisdom](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FIntellectual%20virtues%2FWisdom%20(vi)), which is concerned with first or highest causes. (Part 1-2, 57, a2, response)
$\qquad$”there are diverse habits of scientific knowledge corresponding to the diverse genera of knowable things (*secundum diversa genera scibilium*), whereas wisdom is only unitary (*non sit nisi una*).” (Part 1-2, 57, a2, response)

## As a beatitude
Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. 

The third beatitude.

“Correct judgment about creatures properly pertains to knowledge. But a man is Part 2-2, Question 10 72 sometimes turned away from God by creatures—this according to Wisdom 14:11: “Creatures have become an abomination and a snare to the feet of the unwise,” i.e., to the feet of those who do not have right judgment with respect to creatures, thinking that their perfect good lies in them. Hence, setting creatures up as their end, they sin and lose the true good. Now this loss is made known to a man through correct judgment with respect to creatures, which is had through the gift of knowledge. And this is why the [third] beatitude, which has to do with mourning, is said to correspond to the gift of knowledge. (Part 2-2, Question 10, a4, response)
$\qquad$”**Reply to objection 1**: Created goods do not excite spiritual joy except to the extent that they are referred to the divine good, from which spiritual joy properly arises. And so spiritual peace, and the consequent joy, correspond directly to the gift of wisdom.”
$\qquad$”On the other hand, what corresponds to the gift of knowledge is, first of all, mourning over past mistakes and, after that, consolation, when a man orders creatures toward the divine good through the right judgment of knowledge. And so in the beatitude in question mourning is posited as the merit, and the consequent consolation is posited as the reward, which begins in this life and is brought to perfection in the future life.” (Part 2-2, Question 10, a4, repl to obj. 1)

### Connection of the gifts to the theological virtues
“Now the first union a man has \[with the Holy Spirit] is through faith, hope, and charity. Hence, the gifts presuppose these virtues as the roots, so to speak, of the gifts. Hence, all the gifts have to do with these three virtues insofar as they are certain derivatives of these virtues.” (Part 1-2, q68, a4, rep obj 3)
$\qquad$’whoever has charity has all the gifts of the Holy Spirit, none of which can be had without charity.” (Part 1-2, q68, a5, resp)

### Connection between the gifts
”Joined to understanding is wisdom, which directs it, and joined to fortitude is counsel, which directs it, and joined to [[Piety (g) (b)|piety]] is knowledge, which directs it. Therefore, some directive gift should be added to fear.” (Part 1-2, q68, a4, obj 5)
$\qquad$”two things are posited as corresponding to wisdom in its directive role—viz., the gift of understanding to direct the intellect and the gift of fear to direct the affections. For the notion of the fear of God is based principally on a consideration of God’s excellence, which is what wisdom considers.” (Part 1-2, q68, a4, repl obj 5)

The gift of knowledge is ”Appended to the virtue of [faith](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FTheological%20Virtues%2FFaith%20(v))” (_Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit_, screen 6).

### Connection between the intellectual virtues
**I connect the intellectual virtues together** as follows:
1. [Wisdom (vi)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FIntellectual%20virtues%2FWisdom%20(vi))
2. [Understanding](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FUnderstanding%20(g)%20(b)%20(vi)%20(vm))
3. Scientific knowledge
4. [[Art (vi)]]
5. [Prudence (vi)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FPrudence%20(vi))
**Rationale:** by a “certain ordering” in which “one part is more perfect than another”… scientific knowledge depends on understanding as on what is more important… and both of them depend on wisdom as on that which is most important … and which contains under itself” the others, “insofar as it passes judgment both on the conclusions of the types of scientific knowledge and on the principles of those same types” that is, on matters pertaining to understanding. (Part 1-2 q57, a2 reply to obj 2)
$\qquad$Furthermore, art takes the output of the speculative intellectual virtues and applies it to the craft of a thing. And then prudence makes use or orders art toward right action.

**On the relation between the three speculative intellectual virtues:** they “are not distinguished from one another in exactly the same way (*ex aequo*); rather, they are distinguished by a certain ordering, as happens in the case of potential wholes, one part of which is more perfect than another—in the way that the rational soul is more perfect than the sentient soul and the sentient soul is more perfect than the vegetative soul. For in this way scientific knowledge depends on understanding as on what is more important (*sicut a principaliori*). And both of them depend on wisdom as on that which is most important (*sicut a principalissimo*) and which contains under itself both understanding and scientific knowledge, insofar as it passes judgment both on the conclusions of the types of scientific knowledge and on the principles of those same types of scientific knowledge.”

$\qquad$”And so two things are required for a man’s intellect to assent perfectly to the truth of the Faith. One of them is that he should correctly grasp the things that are proposed, and this, as was explained above (q. 8, a. 6), belongs to the gift of understanding. But the other is that he should have firm and correct judgment about those things, viz., by distinguishing things that are to be believed from things that are not to be believed. And for this the gift of knowledge is necessary.” (Part 2-2, Q 10, response)

### The connection of the gifts to the intellectual and moral virtues
“it is clear that these gifts extend to everything that the virtues, both intellectual and moral, extend to.” (Part 1-2, q68, a4 resp)
$\qquad$“reason is speculative and practical, and in both speculative reason and practical reason there is (a) apprehension of truth, which pertains to discovery, and (b) judgment concerning truth. Thus, with respect to the apprehension of truth, speculative reason is perfected by *understanding* (g), whereas practical reason is perfected by [*counsel (g)*](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FCounsel%20(g)%20Mercy%20(b)%20(v)). And with respect to judging correctly, speculative reason is perfected by [*wisdom (g)*](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FWisdom%20(g)%20(b)), whereas practical reason is perfected by [*knowledge (g)*](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FKnowledge%20(g)%20(b)) (cf. ST 2-2, q. 8, a. 6).” (Part 1-2, q68, a4 resp)
$\qquad$Thus:
		1. Speculative reason pertaining to discovery means [understanding (vi)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FUnderstanding%20(g)%20(b)%20(vi)%20(vm))
		2. Speculative reason pertaining to judging correctly means [wisdom (vi)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FWisdom%20(g)%20(vi)%20Peace%20(b))
		3. Practical reason pertaining to discovery means [prudence (vi)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FPrudence%20(vi))
		4. Practical reason pertaining to judging correctly means scientific knowledge (vi).
“in those matters that have to do with others, the appetitive power is perfected by *piety (g)*, whereas in those matters that have to do with oneself, it is perfected by *fortitude (g)* in the face of the fearful dangers and by *fear (g)* in the face of a disordered desire for pleasant things” (Part 1-2, q68, a4 resp)
$\qquad$Thus, 
		5. “those matters that have to with others” refers to [justice (vm)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FJustice%20(vm))
		6.  “those matters that have to with oneself” … “in the face of fearful dangers” refers to [courage (vm)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FCourage%20(vm))
		7. “those matters that have to with oneself”… “in the face of a disordered desire for pleasant things” refers to [temperance (vm)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FTemperance%20(vm))

### Connection between the gifts
”Joined to understanding is wisdom, which directs it, and joined to fortitude is counsel, which directs it, and joined to piety is knowledge, which directs it. Therefore, some directive gift should be added to fear.” (Part 1-2, q68, a4, obj 5)
$\qquad$”two things are posited as corresponding to wisdom in its directive role—viz., the gift of understanding to direct the intellect and the gift of fear to direct the affections. For the notion of the fear of God is based principally on a consideration of God’s excellence, which is what wisdom considers.” (Part 1-2, q68, a4, repl obj 5)

### Connection of the gifts to the beatitudes
/
	1. Generic: 
		(a) The beatitudes are connected to [hope], since they are “micro-narratives” which link an undesirable state with a promised future state (*Faith, Hope and Love*, p. 50). 
		/
		(b) The beatitudes exhibit a shift from (i) more passive states, such as mourning and meekness, to more active states like exercising mercy and making peace; (ii) a shift from first-personal need (e.g. “poor in spirit”) to a focus on other persons and a “care and outpouring of love for other persons”. “The Christian life \[…] gradually becomes more ecstatic and outward-focused, as the exercise of the virtue of hope gradually enables and gives way to the practice of [divine love]” (*Faith, Hope and Love*, p. 51). 
		$\qquad$Thus **I infer** that the third beatitude connects narratively to the [fourth beatitude, righteousness](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FCourage%20(g)%20Righteousness%20(b)).
			/
	2. Specific
		(c) beatitudes are enumerated by (a) reference to the concupiscible and irascible parts of the soul and (b) their relation to the “three kinds of beatitude” which “various authors have posited” (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp). The first “kind” is a false kind of beatitude and is to be resisted, the second kind is to be strengthened, and the third shares in the essence of true beatitude and is thus a reward for the perfect of the second kind. Concerning the first kind, Aquinas relies in part on the gospel of Luke, which only gives four beatitudes, to account for the various kind of resistance to the pleasurable life:
>		*Luke reports that our Lord’s sermon was delivered to the crowds. Hence, he numbers the beatitudes in keeping with the capacity of the crowds, which knew only pleasurable and temporal and earthly beatitude. Hence, by the four beatitudes our Lord rules out the four things that seem to pertain to this sort of beatitude. The first is an abundance of exterior things, which he rules out by saying, “Blessed are the poor.” The second is a man’s being well off with respect to his body, in food and drink and other such things; and he rules this out in the second beatitude by saying, “Blessed are those who hunger.” The third is a man’s being well off with respect to hearty enjoyment (*cordis iucunditas*), *and he rules this out with the third beatitude by saying, “Blessed are they who are now mourning.” The fourth is external favor in the eyes of men, and he rules this out with the fourth beatitude by saying, “Blessed will you be when men hate you.”*

/
		The first, second, and third beatitudes “remove the obstacle posed by \[the first kind of beatitude, a false kind of beatitude,] the *pleasurable life*” (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp). “Blessed are the poor in spirit…” is thus read as a blessed deprivation of pleasure, referring either “to the contempt for riches or to the contempt for honours that results from humility” (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp). 
		$\qquad$“Blessed are those who mourn…” is read as not merely using concupiscible passions with moderation, as virtue directs, but if necessary, “wholly casting them aside… or even taking on a willful sorrow” (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp). The stance is one of almost flamboyant disregard due to a profound detachment, presumably due to a far greater and more beautiful love for (and from) God.
		$\qquad$ “Blessed are the meek…” is read as being “wholly undisturbed” by irascible passions as a result of the action of a gift (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp). The stance is one of complete insulation from the striving of irascible passions, due to the gift of piety by which “we are moved to regard other persons as God regards them, namely as potential or actual children [of God], and thereby our brothers and sisters” (_Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit_, screen 8).
		$\qquad$The fourth and fifth beatitudes strengthen us in the second kind of beatitude, the active life, which to Aquinas “consists principally in what we render to our neighbours, either as a debt or a spontaneous gift” (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp). “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst or justice…” thus surpasses the virtue of justice’s reasonable desire with a “fervent desire that we fulfil the works of justice” (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp). 
		$\qquad$”Blessed are the merciful…” is read as pertaining to the “spontaneous gift” clause above, and it surpasses the reasonable giving of gifts to “friends or others who are joined to us” in accordance with [liberality](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Justice%2FLiberality%20(vm)), by extending generosity further afield as per Luke 14:12-13: “When you fix a dinner or a supper, do not invite your friends or rothers… but invite the poor and the maimed.” This, Aquinas claims, is “properly speaking, to show mercy” (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp). Interestingly, the gift-driven generosity \[is it really mercy?] does *not* include friends or brothers, it leaves these to reason “out of reverence for God” (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp).
		$\qquad$The sixth and seventh beatitudes are *rewards*, that is, at least the beginning of a partaking in final beatitude, since the third kind of beatitude, the contemplative life, is thought to share in its essence (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp). Thus, the gift of understanding is how we grasp what is proposed to us by God, and “blessed are the pure of heart…” has *seeing God* as a reward for the cleansing of the heart through the second kind of beatitude.
		$\qquad$The gift of wisdom is right judgment on account of “connaturality” with supernatural things, due to “adoptive filiation” (Part 1-2, q69, a3, resp). This, ”blessed are the peacemakers…” has *being a son of God* as an effect of the active life “by which a man is perfected in relation to his neighbour” (Part 1-2, q69, a3, repl obj 1). Aquinas cites Isaiah 32:17 – “the work of justice is peace” to establish this relation. So… *the gift of becoming a son of God is the reward for bringing one’s relations to neighbours to a state of peace.*
			/
	3. As for **how the promissory rewards within each beatitude are connected**, Aquinas, in responding to an objection that the rewards seem to be back-to-front, writes the following:
	
> 		*The rewards are likewise ordered to one another by addition. For it is more to possess the land (*terra*) *of the kingdom of heaven than simply to have the kingdom of heaven, since we have many things which we do not possess peacefully and with security. It is also more to be consoled in the kingdom than to have and possess the kingdom, since we possess many things with sorrow. Likewise, it is more to have one’s fill than simply to be consoled, since having one’s fill implies an abundance of consolation. Yet mercy exceeds having one’s fill, in the sense that a man receives more than he has merited or could desire. And it is still greater to see God, just as it is greater for someone not only to dine in the king’s court but also to see the king’s face. Moreover, the king’s son has the highest place in the royal household.* (Part 1-2, q69, a4, repl obj 3)


### All beatitudes are (perfect) fruits
Also: “all the beatitudes can be called fruits, but not *vice versa*.” Moreover, beatitudes are perfect fruits! -which, “by reason of their perfection, are attributed more to the gifts than to the virtues.” (Part 1-2, q70, a2 resp)

// makes me wonder whether *expression* of bodily desires, not just the exercise of *restraint*, also has its own set of fruits! 

### Connection to fruits
$\qquad$[[Benignity (f)]]is ”the principal fruit of the Holy Spirit that culminates \[the] transformation \[of the third beatitude, mourning]” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 34).

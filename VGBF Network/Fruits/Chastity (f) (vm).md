Chastity (*Castitas*) (f): either the curbing of unlawful sense desires, or neither experiencing (lawful or unlawful) sense desires nor being led astray by them. (Part 1-2, q70, a3, resp)

“Chastity has the nature of a virtue insofar as it operates in accord with reason, whereas it is numbered among the fruits insofar as it has delight in its act.” 
$\qquad$A fruit pertaining to the body.

**Role of the body and the soul:** “Chastity is seated in the soul as in a subject, but it has its subject matter in the body. For chastity involves an individual’s using his bodily members in moderation according to the judgment of reason and the choice of the will.” (Part 2-2, Question 151, a3, response)

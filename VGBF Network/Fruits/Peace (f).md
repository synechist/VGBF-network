Peace (*Pax*) (f): undisturbed order.
	“Moreover, the perfection of joy is [peace (b)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FWisdom%20(g)%20(vi)%20Peace%20(b))” because to perfect joy requires (a) “repose from external circumstances” and (b) the pacification of restless desire. For one does not rejoice perfectly over something if \[he is distracted by internal circumstances, like disordered passions].” (Part 1-2, q70, a3, resp)
	$\qquad$“a twofold union… the result of one’s own appetites being ordered toward one thing; \[and] one’s own appetite being united with the appetite of another” (*Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit*, screen 16).
	$\qquad$Evidently, Aquinas has in mind a peace between people, not “inner peace,” even though Peace falls within the “good ordering of the mind” category rather than the “pertaining to one’s neighbour” category.
	$\qquad$Exemplified in [friendship](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Justice%2FFriendliness%20(vm)), thus formally a relation: “it is reckoned a sign of friendship if people ‘make choice of the same things’ (*Ethic.* ix, 4), and Tully says (*De Amicitia*) that friends like and dislike the same things.[^7] In the article cited…, Aquinas highlights the interpersonal aspect of the Fruit of Peace and its connection with friendship, observing that Peace implies a harmony between two persons.“ (*Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit*, screens 16-17).

“A fruit (alongside love, joy, patience and perseverance) pertaining to the good ordering of the mind,” so, **by my inference**, linked to the cognitive gifts via some manner of intermediate virtues and beatitudes.

2. [Knowledge (g)]
3. [Wisdom (g)]
4. [Counsel (g)]

Peace (*Pax*) (f): “a twofold union… the result of one’s own appetites being ordered toward one thing; \[and] one’s own appetite being united with the appetite of another” (*Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit*, screen 16). **By my inference**, it is then linked to the appetitive gifts too (via some manner of intermediate virtues and beatitudes).

2. [Piety (g)]
3. [Courage (g)]
$\qquad$Evidently, Aquinas has in mind a peace between people, not “inner peace,” even though Peace falls within the “good ordering of the mind” category rather than the “pertaining to one’s neighbour” category.

And additionally, since peace is partly an ordering of appetites, it is surely connected to the gifts via [temperance (vm)].

Peace is related (see above) to friendship; but friendship is a potential part of [Justice (v)], and so it must connect to the gifts via justice too.

And, as expected, its ultimate origin is that of the originary virtue of love:

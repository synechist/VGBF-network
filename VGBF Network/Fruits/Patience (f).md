Patience (*Patientia*) (f): not being disturbed by the threat of evil things or the (threat of a) lack of a good thing.
	“Not \[being] disturbed by the threat of evil things.” The first of “two respects in which a mind does well in the face of evils,” which includes lacking a good. (Part 1-2, q70, a3, resp)

“Associated with [Courage (vm)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FCourage%20(vm))” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 39).

Same underlying disposition as the homonymous virtue of [patience](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Courage%2FPatience%20(vm)), with the added attribute of delight: “it is common for the name ‘virtues’ to signify the acts of the virtues as well. And so patience, as regards the habit, is posited as a virtue with respect to the delight that it has in its act, whereas it is posited as a fruit mainly because it is through patience that one’s mind is preserved from being overwhelmed by sadness.” (Part 2-2, q136, a1, repl obj 3)

The [fourth beatitude, righteousness](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FCourage%20(g)%20Righteousness%20(b)) “is in turn associated with … the fruits (fructus) of Patience and Long-suffering \[perseverance]” (*Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit*, screen 5).

“A fruit (alongside love, joy, peace, and perseverance) pertaining to the good ordering of the mind,” so, **by my inference**, linked to the cognitive gifts (rather than to the appetitive gifts) via some manner of intermediate virtues and beatitudes.

Faith (*Fides*) (f): the fruition of certitude
$\qquad$“the fruits of the Spirit are certain ultimate and delectable things that come to exist in us by the power of the Holy Spirit. Now what is ultimate and delectable has the character of an end, which is the proper object of the will. And so what is ultimate and delectable in the will must in some sense be the fruit of everything else that belongs to the other powers. 
$\qquad$So, then, there are two possible fruits of a gift or virtue that perfects a power, one which belongs to its own power, and the other of which is, as it were, ultimate and belongs to the will. 
$\qquad$Accordingly, one should reply that faith, i.e., the certitude of faith, corresponds to the gift of [understanding](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FUnderstanding%20(g)%20(vi)%20(vm)%20Purity%20(b)) as its own proper fruit, whereas joy, which belongs to the will, corresponds to it as its ultimate fruit.”  (Part 2-2, Q8, response)

“**Reply to objection 2:** Faith cannot in all cases (*universaliter*) precede understanding, since a man could not assent by belief to anything proposed to him unless he in some sense understood it. However, the perfection of understanding does follow upon the [faith](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FTheological%20Virtues%2FFaith%20(v)) which is a virtue, and the certitude of faith follows upon this perfection of understanding” (Part 2-2, Q8, reply to obj 2)

A fruit pertaining to one’s neighbour.

Love (*Caritas*) (f):
$\qquad$[Love (vt)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FTheological%20Virtues%2FLove%20(vt)) as an affection, which is also a likeness of God, thus a oneness too.
		“The first affection and the root of all affections,” “…in which the Holy Spirit is given in a special way, as in a proper likeness of Himself, since He Himself is the Love (*Amor*) cf. ST 1, q. 37).” (Part 1-2, q70, a3, resp)
		$\qquad$Aquinas “associates… *Caritas* with both a union of affections and a union of persons”[^8] (*Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit*, screen 17).

“A fruit (alongside joy, peace, patience and perseverance) pertaining to the good ordering of the mind,” so, **by my inference**, linked to the cognitive gifts (rather than to the appetitive gifts) via some manner of intermediate virtues and beatitudes.

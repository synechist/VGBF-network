Joy (*Gaudium*) (f): rejoicing at being one with a beloved.
	“Joy necessarily follows upon the love of charity. For every love rejoices at being joined to what he loves. \[And] charity always has God, whom it loves, present. Hence, what follows from charity is *joy* (*gaudium*).” (Part 1-2, q70, a3, resp)
	$\qquad$Aquinas “associates Joy with the experience of God abiding in a person” (*Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit*, screen 17).

The ultimate fruit of the gift of [understanding](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FUnderstanding%20(g)%20(vi)%20(vm)%20Purity%20(b)).
$\qquad$“the fruits of the Spirit are certain ultimate and delectable things that come to exist in us by the power of the Holy Spirit. Now what is ultimate and delectable has the character of an end, which is the proper object of the will. And so what is ultimate and delectable in the will must in some sense be the fruit of everything else that belongs to the other powers. 
$\qquad$So, then, there are two possible fruits of a gift or virtue that perfects a power, one which belongs to its own power, and the other of which is, as it were, ultimate and belongs to the will. 
$\qquad$Accordingly, one should reply that faith, i.e., the certitude of faith, corresponds to the gift of understanding as its own proper fruit, whereas joy, which belongs to the will, corresponds to it as its ultimate fruit.”  (Part 2-2, Q8, response)

“A fruit (alongside love, peace, patience and perseverance) pertaining to the good ordering of the mind,” so, **by my inference**, linked to the cognitive gifts (rather than to the appetitive gifts) via some manner of intermediate virtues and beatitudes.

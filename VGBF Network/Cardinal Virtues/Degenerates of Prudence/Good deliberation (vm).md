Good deliberation (vm) (*euboulia*): “good deliberating”; corresponds to an act “of the speculative intellect, viz. to inquire (*inquirere*).” (Part 1-2, q57,a6, resp)

**Relation to prudence:** “Prudence involves deliberating well (*est bene consiliativa*) not in the sense that its act is directly to deliberate well, but in the sense that it perfects the act of deliberating by the mediation of a virtue that is subject to it, viz., good deliberating (*eubulia*).”(Part 1-2, q57,a6, repl obj 2)

**Relation to prudence, the integral parts, and the subjective parts:** “Memory, understanding, and foresight—and, likewise, caution, docility and other things of this sort—are not virtues distinct from prudence, but are in some sense related to prudence as *integral parts*, insofar as they are all required for the perfection of prudence. There are also certain *subjective parts*, or *species*, of prudence, e.g., economic prudence, kingly prudence, etc. But the three virtues under discussion here are, as it were, *potential parts* of prudence, since they are ordered toward prudence in the way that what is secondary is related to what is principal. More will be said about this below (ST 2-2, qq. 48ff.)” (Part 1-2, q57, a6, rep to obj 4)

**Important note on the classification of the virtues listed as parts of prudence:** “all these things are posited as parts of prudence not in all their generality but according to the relation they have to the things that pertain to prudence” (Part 2-2, q48, a1, rep obj 3)
$\qquad$That is, **they could pertain to other virtues, gifts, beatitudes, fruits or other kinds of act.**

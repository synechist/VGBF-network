Good sense (vm): good judgment in exceptional cases (*bona gnome*), “which has to do with situations in which one must depart from the common law. (Part 2-2, q48, a1 response)

Equitableness (*Epikeia*) (v): “the virtue of setting aside the letter of human laws in special cases in which the letter of the law would contravene justice.” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, pp.28-29).

**Identity of good sense and equitableness:** “Equitableness (*epieikeia*) is adjoined to legal justice and not to particular justice. And it seems to be the same as what has been called good sense (*eugnomosyna*)” (*ST* 2-2 q.80, response to obj 5)

A *potential part* of [prudence](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FPrudence%20(v)), that is, good sense is among the “adjoining virtues that are ordered toward certain secondary acts or subject matters—not having, as it were, the full power of the principal virtue”. (“By contrast, prudence has to do with the principal act, which is to command”.) (Part 2-2, q48, a1 response)

**Relation to prudence, the integral parts, and the subjective parts:** “Memory, understanding, and foresight—and, likewise, caution, docility and other things of this sort—are not virtues distinct from prudence, but are in some sense related to prudence as *integral parts*, insofar as they are all required for the perfection of prudence. There are also certain *subjective parts*, or *species*, of prudence, e.g., economic prudence, kingly prudence, etc. But the three virtues under discussion here are, as it were, *potential parts* of prudence, since they are ordered toward prudence in the way that what is secondary is related to what is principal. More will be said about this below (ST 2-2, qq. 48ff.)” (Part 1-2, q57, a6, rep to obj 4)

**Relation to Justice:** “Now these two virtues are attributed to [prudence](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FPrudence%20(v)) as that which directs them, but to [justice](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FJustice%20(v)) as that which executes them.” (*ST* 2-2 q.80, response to obj 4.)”

$\qquad$Good sense (*eugnomosyna*) (v): “as regards things to be done in particular cases that sometimes lie beyond the common laws, \[Tully] posits good sense (*eugnomosyna*), i.e., good judgment in exceptional cases (*bona gnome*), which, as was established in the tract on prudence (q. 51, a. 4), is directive in such matters… Now these two virtues are attributed to [prudence](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FPrudence%20(v)) as that which directs them, but to [justice](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FJustice%20(v)) as that which executes them.” (*ST* 2-2 q.80, response to obj 4.)

“Now at times it happens that something has to be done outside of the common rules of action, e.g., that something one has been entrusted with should not be returned as long as one’s homeland is under attack, or something else of this sort. And so one must pass judgment about such things by reference to principles that are higher than the common rules by reference to which [*synesis*](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FGood%20common%20judgment%20(vd)) judges. And these higher principles require a higher virtue of judging, and this higher virtue is called *gnome*, which implies a sort of perspicacity in judging.” (Part 2-2, q51, response)

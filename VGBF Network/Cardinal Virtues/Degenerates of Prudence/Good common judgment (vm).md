Good common judgment (vm) (*synesis*): “which has to do with situations that commonly occur”

**Distinction from [good deliberation](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FGood%20deliberation%20(vm))** and [good particular judgment](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Prudence%2FGood%20sense%20(vd)): “A *judgment* regarding a given thing is made through its *proper* principles. But an *inquiry* is not made through the thing’s proper principles, since once those principles are had, then there is no need for inquiry, but the matter has already been figured out (*iam res esset inventa*). And so just one virtue is ordered toward deliberating well… \[but] the demonstrative sciences, which pass judgment, are diverse with respect to diverse things. \[Accordingly,] *synesis* and *gnome* are distinguished from one another by the diverse rules by which they judge. For *synesis* passes judgment about what has to be done in accord with ordinary law (*secundum communem legem*), whereas *gnome* passes judgment in accord with natural reason itself in cases in which ordinary law falls short. This will be explained more fully below (ST 2-2, q. 51, a. 4).” (Part 1-2, q57, a6, rep to obj 3)


**Relation to prudence, the integral parts, and the subjective parts:** “Memory, understanding, and foresight—and, likewise, caution, docility and other things of this sort—are not virtues distinct from prudence, but are in some sense related to prudence as *integral parts*, insofar as they are all required for the perfection of prudence. There are also certain *subjective parts*, or *species*, of prudence, e.g., economic prudence, kingly prudence, etc. But the three virtues under discussion here are, as it were, *potential parts* of prudence, since they are ordered toward prudence in the way that what is secondary is related to what is principal. More will be said about this below (ST 2-2, qq. 48ff.)” (Part 1-2, q57, a6, rep to obj 4)

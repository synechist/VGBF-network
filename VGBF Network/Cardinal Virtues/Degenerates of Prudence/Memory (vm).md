Memory (v) (*memoria*) – “for cognition about things that are past”

An “integral part” of [[Prudence (vi)|prudence]], that is, “in the way that the walls, roof, and foundation are parts of a house”; “the parts of the virtue are the things that must come together for a complete or perfect act of that virtue” (Part 2-2, q48, a1 response)

**Important note on the classification of memory and the other virtues listed as parts of prudence:** “all these things are posited as parts of prudence not in all their generality but according to the relation they have to the things that pertain to prudence” (Part 2-2, q48, a1, rep obj 3)
$\qquad$That is, **they could pertain to other virtues, gifts, beatitudes, fruits or other kinds of act.**

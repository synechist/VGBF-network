Sanctity (vm) (*Sanctitas*): Andronicus Peripateticus “says of [piety](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Justice%2FReligion%20(vm)) that it is “knowledge of the service of God” (and he says this in the sense in which Socrates claimed that all virtues are types of knowledge.) And as will be explained below (q. 81, a. 8), he traces sanctity (*sanctitas*) back to the same thing.

A degenerate of [justice](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FJustice%20(v)).

Sanctity (_Sanctitas_) (v): “[piety](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Justice%2FReligion%20(vm)) (*eusebia*) is here said to be good worship, and so it is the same thing as religion. This is why he says of it that it is “knowledge of the service of God” (and he says this in the sense in which Socrates claimed that all virtues are types of knowledge.) And as will be explained below (q. 81, a. 8), he traces sanctity (*sanctitas*) back to the same thing.” (_ST_ 2-2 q.80, reply to obj 4.)

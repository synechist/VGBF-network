Liberality/Generosity (*Liberalitas*) (vm): the good use of monetary wealth or riches (Part 2-2, q117, a3, resp)
$\qquad$“the proper matter of generosity or liberality is monetary wealth.” (Part 2-2, Question 117, a2, response)
$\qquad$“”it is clear that where there is a special matter having a special excellence, one finds a specific nature of virtue; this is obvious in the case of [magnificence](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Courage%2FMagnificence%20(vm)), which has to do with great sums of money, and because of this it is a specific virtue distinct from generosity, which itself has to do generally with any use of money.”

(Part 2-2, Question 152, a3, response)”
 “Generosity (*liberalitas*), on the other hand, seems to belong to [[VGBF Network/Cardinal Virtues/Degenerates of Justice/Being humane (vm)|being humane]]” (*ST* 2-2 q.80, reply to obj 4).

**Distinction from [magnificence](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Courage%2FMagnificence%20(vm)):** “magnificence is in a certain sense related to generosity by way of addition” (Part 2-2, q117, a3, rep obj 1)
$\qquad$“Magnificence adds to the subject matter of generosity a sort of magnitude that pertains to the notion of *the arduous*, which is the object of the irascible appetite, and it is the irascible appetite that fortitude principally perfects. And on this score magnificence belongs to fortitude.” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, repl obj 1)

## Network
A degenerate of [justice](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FJustice%20(v)).

An enlarged-scope of [[Magnificence (vm)|magnificence]], in the sense that liberality it is generosity in any respect, while magnificence is only concerned with the “notion of the arduous.” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, repl obj 1) Liberality’s scope, however, is also reduced, in that it is concerned only with the use of monetary wealth or riches, and not with any great or arduous work.

### Vices
The virtuous mean between the vices of [[Avarice (vice)]] and [[Prodigality (vice)]].
$\qquad$Pinsent observes that Jesus’ liberality when he asks a disciple to catch a fish, out of the mouth of which comes a coin to pay tax to Caesar, illuminates how “a recollection of the larger context \[i.e. in which God our father gives us everything we need], with a touch of humour, may be helpful in breaking the spell \[of fear, anxiety associated with avarice].” (Pinsent, Avarice and Liberality, p.174) This same freedom, though, is distinguished from the “free” use of money exhibited in prodigality in that the freedom of liberality is fired by [love (vt)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FTheological%20Virtues%2FLove%20(vt)), with which we understand (through joint attention) the circumstances of others and liberally give what is needed for their good to be attained. That is, the distinction lies in the vices consisting in a shrinking into a first-person perspective, and the virtue acting upon a second-person perspective.

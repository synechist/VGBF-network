A degenerate of [justice](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FJustice%20(v)).

Good exchange (*bona commutatio*) (v): “good exchange (bona commutatio), of which he says that it is “a habit that safeguards equality or balance in exchanges,” belongs to particular justice. And good lawmaking (legispositiva), which is, as he himself says, “the knowledge of political exchanges related to the community,” belongs to legal justice as regards those things that have to be observed by everyone (communiter sunt observanda).” (*ST* 2-2 q.80, reply to obj 4.)

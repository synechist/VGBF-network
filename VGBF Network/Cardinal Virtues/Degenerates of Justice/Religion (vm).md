Religion (_Religio_) (v): “bear[s] a family resemblance to justice, insofar as God, being God, is worthy and owed our devotion, prayer, worship and other kinds of service. But no service is wholly adequate to God because of the disproportionate difference between God’s being and our own. Hence religion resembles justice, but is not a kind of justice, properly speaking, because of the unequalness between the parties involved” (_Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance_, p.28).  

”the most important of these associated virtues and covers, among other matters, devotion and prayer, worship, and various kinds of service to God by gifts” (_Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance_, p. 28).

There are also opposing vices to religion, namely [[Superstition (vice)]] and [[Irreligion (vice)]]” (_Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance_, p.28).

Affection (affectus) – “insofar as \[someone’s] goods please one“ (Part 2-2, q80, a1, repl obj 2)
$\qquad$”Kindness (*benignitas*) seems to be the same as affection (affectus), which Macrobius posits. Hence, in Etymologia Isidore says, “Kindness is a man prepared to do good on the spur of the moment and a man gentle in speech.” And Andronicus himself says that kindness is “the habit of doing good spontaneously.”

And so three things belong to [[Friendliness (vm)|friendliness]] (amicitia), viz., 
	 (a) benevolence, which is here called affection; 
	 (b) concord, and 
	 (c) beneficence, which is here called being humane.”
		 Discipline “can be included under being humane, which is where Macrobius puts it” (*ST* 2-2 q.80, reply to obj 3).

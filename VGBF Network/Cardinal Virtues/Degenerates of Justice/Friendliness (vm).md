Friendship (*Amicitia*) (v): “understood here insofar as it orders exterior intercourse, in the way that the Philosopher talks about it in *Ethics* 6.” (*ST* 2-2 q.80, reply to obj 3).

Affability or friendliness (affabilitas sive amicitia) “in exterior interactions and interior concord” (Part 2-2, q80, a1, repl obj 2)


## Network
A degenerate of [Justice (v)|justice](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FJustice%20(v)).

Friendliness is connected with the fruit of [[Peace (f)|peace]], which is not only a fruit of the cognitive gifts (which connected with justice and others) but also of the appetitive gifts. **I infer** therefore that friendliness is connected via the virtue of [temperance (vm)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FTemperance%20(vm)), or else one would quickly fail to be friendly as soon as some intemperate desire arose (e.g. hangriness).
### Degenerates
Friendliness can also be taken insofar as it properly has to do with affection, as is determined by the Philosopher in *Ethics* 8 and 9. And so three things belong to friendliness (amicitia), viz., 
	 (a) [[Affection (vm)|benevolence]], which is here called affection; 
	 (b) [[Concord (vm)|concord]], and 
	 (c) [[VGBF Network/Cardinal Virtues/Degenerates of Justice/Being humane (vm)|beneficence]], which is here called being humane.”
		 [discipline](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Justice%2FDiscipline%20(vd))) “can be included under being humane, which is where Macrobius puts it” (*ST* 2-2 q.80, reply to obj 3).

[[Fairness (vm)]] is a degenerate of [equitableness](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Justice%2FEquitableness%20(vm)) or friendliness: 
$\qquad$“Fairness (*equitas*), on the other hand, falls under equitableness (*epieikeia*) or under friendliness (*amicitia*)” (*ST* 2-2 q.80, response to obj 3.)

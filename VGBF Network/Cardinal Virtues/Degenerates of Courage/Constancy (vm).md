[[Constancy (vm)]]: “not stopping because of any …obstacle \[including how long things are taking, which is perseverance].” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, rep obj 6)

## Network
**An integral part of magnificence:** constance “can be included under [[Magnificence (vm)|magnificence]], since it is necessary to have a constant mind in cases where someone is doing something magnificently (*in his quae magnifice aliquis facit*). And this is why Tully claims that magnificence involves not only “one’s managing great things, but also the mind’s thinking them through in a capacious manner.””

**Perseverance is a potential part of constancy:** “constancy can pertain to [[Perseverance (vm)|perseverance]], since one is said to persevere in light of the fact that he does not stop because of how long things are taking (*propter diuturnitatem*), whereas one is said to be constant in light of the fact that he does not stop because of any other sort of obstacle.” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, rep obj 6)

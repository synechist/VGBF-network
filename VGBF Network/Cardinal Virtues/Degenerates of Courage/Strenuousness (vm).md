[[Strenuousness (vm)|Strenuousness]] (*Strenuitas*) (vm): to “carry out \[great works] with a virile prudence and care.” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, repl obj 6)
$\qquad$To magnificence \[Andronicus] adds *andragathia* in the sense of virile goodness (*virilis bonitas*), which can be called *strenuousness* (*strenuitas*) among us. For it pertains to *magnificence* not only that a man should be consistent in carrying out great works, which pertains to *constancy*, but also that he should carry them out with a virile prudence and care, which pertains to *andragathia* or *strenuousness*. Hence, he says, “Andragathia is the virtue of a man that dreams up shared works (*viri virtus adinventiva commnicabilium operum*).

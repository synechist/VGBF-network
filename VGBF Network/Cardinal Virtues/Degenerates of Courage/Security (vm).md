Security (*Securitas*) (vm): “a kind of complete repose of the mind from fear” (Part 2-2, q129, a7, resp)
$\qquad$”firm hope cannot exist unless the contrary is removed; for at times someone, as far as he himself is concerned, would hope for something, but the hope is destroyed by the impediment of fear, given that, as was established above (ST 1-2, q. 40, a. 4), fear is contrary to hope. And this is why Macrobius adds security, which excludes fear.” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, repl obj 6)

## Network
**Connection to hope:** security bolsters against fear, the contrary of hope (“which cannot exist unless \[its] contrary is removed” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, repl obj 6)) and thus works alongside [hope](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FTheological%20Virtues%2FHope%20(vt)) to support confidence.

**An integral part of magnanimity:** “security belongs to [[Magnanimity (vm)|magnanimity]] *in the manner of a consequence* insofar as it drives off despair.” (Part 2-2, q129, a7, resp, italics added)

**An integral part of confidence:** because confidence cannot exist unless \[its] contrary is removed” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, repl obj 6)), security thus works alongside [hope](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FTheological%20Virtues%2FHope%20(vt)) to support [[Confidence (vm)|confidence]].

**A potential part of courage:** “security implies a kind of complete repose of the mind from fear, just as confidence implies a certain strength of hope. And so just as hope belongs directly to magnanimity, so security belongs directly to [fortitude](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FCourage%20(vm)).” (Part 2-2, q129, a7, resp) But “Fortitude is not praised mainly because it has no fear—which is what security involves. Instead, it is praised mainly because it involves a certain firmness in the passions. Hence, security is not the same as fortitude, but is instead a certain condition of fortitude.” (Part 2-2, q129, a7, repl obj 1)

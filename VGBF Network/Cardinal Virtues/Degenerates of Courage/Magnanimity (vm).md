Magnanimity (*Magnanimitas*) (vm): “the spirit’s reaching out toward great things.” (Part 2-2, q129, a1, resp); “magnanimity has to do properly with the hope for something arduous.” (Part 2-2, q129, a6, resp)
$\qquad$“the disposition to undertake great acts of any kind, the achievement of which are worthy of the highest honours” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 37).

A secondary virtue under [courage](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FCourage%20(vm)):
$\qquad$”it is more difficult to behave with firmness in the face of the danger of death, with respect to which fortitude strengthens the mind, than in cases of hoping for or attaining the greatest goods, with respect to which magnanimity strengthens the mind.” (Part 2-2, q129, a5, resp)
$\qquad$”it falls short of fortitude because it strengthens the mind in a matter in which it is easier to maintain firmness. Hence, magnanimity is posited as a part of fortitude because it is adjoined to it in the way that what is secondary is adjoined to what is principal.” (Part 2-2, q129, a6, resp)

**Connection to [confidence](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Courage%2FConfidence%20(vm))**: “one can say that confidence pertains to the certitude of the hope, whereas magnanimity pertains to the greatness of the thing hoped for.” (Part 2-2, q128, a1 repl obj 6)
$\qquad$“confidence implies a certain mode of hope, since confidence is hope that has been strengthened by a firm opinion” (Part 2-2, q129, a6, resp obj 3). Now “magnanimity has to do properly with the hope for something arduous. And so, since confidence implies a strength of hope that derives from a thought which effects a strong opinion about pursuing a good, it follows that confidence belongs to magnanimity.” (Part 2-2, q129, a6, resp)
$\qquad$”*hope* (*spes*) is directly opposed to *despair* (*desperatio*), which has the same object, viz. the good. On the other hand, if we assume contrariety among the objects, then hope is opposed to *fear*, which has the bad as its object. Now confidence implies a sort of strength of hope. And so it is opposed to fear in the same way that hope is. But because fortitude properly speaking strengthens a man against evils, whereas magnanimity strengthens him in the pursuit of honor, it follows that confidence belongs more properly to magnanimity than to fortitude. On the other hand, since hope is a cause of daring, which belongs to fortitude, it follows that confidence belongs to fortitude in the manner of a consequence.” (Part 2-2, q129, a6, repl obj 2)

**Security is an integral part of magnanimity:** “[Security](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FSecurity%20(vm)) belongs to magnanimity *in the manner of a consequence* insofar as it drives off despair.” (Part 2-2, q129, a7, resp, italics added)

“As is clear from its very name, magnificence involves doing or making something great.” (Part 2-2, Question 134, a2, response)
$\qquad$“the disposition to undertake and administer great works” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 37).
$\qquad$“‘to do with thinking about and managing’—i.e. executing–’great and lofty undertakings, with a capacious and noble purpose of mind’—so that management is not lacking for one’s capacious plans.” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, resp)

“it is clear that where there is a special matter having a special excellence, one finds a specific nature of virtue; this is obvious in the case of magnificence, which has to do with great sums of money, and because of this it is a specific virtue distinct from generosity, which itself has to do generally with any use of money.”

**Distinction from [liberality](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Justice%2FLiberality%20(vm)):** “Magnificence adds to the subject matter of generosity a sort of magnitude that pertains to the notion of *the arduous*, which is the object of the irascible appetite, and it is the irascible appetite that fortitude principally perfects. And on this score magnificence belongs to fortitude.” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, repl obj 1)

A degenerate of the virtue of [[Courage (vm)|courage]].
A secondary virtue of courage when the “great undertaking” does not involve facing death.

A reduced-scope version of [[Liberality (vm)|liberality]], in the sense that liberality is generosity in any respect, while magnificence is only concerned with the “notion of the arduous.” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, repl obj 1) Magnificence’s scope, however, is also enlarged, in that it is concerned with any great or arduous work, while liberality is concerned only with the use of monetary wealth or riches.

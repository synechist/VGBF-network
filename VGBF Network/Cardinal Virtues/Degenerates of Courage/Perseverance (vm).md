Perseverance (*Perseverantia*) (vm): “the stable and continued persistence in a well thought out purpose” …”that *a man not become fatigued by the extended suffering of difficulties to the point he gives up.*” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, resp)
$\qquad$“the disposition to persist long in something difficult until it is accomplished” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 37).

**Identifying mark of infused perseverance:** “‘perseverance’ can be used for an *act of perseverance that lasts right up to death*. And on this score it needs not only habitual grace, but also, as was explained above when we were talking about grace (*ST* 1-2, q. 109, a. 10), the gratuitous assistance of God, who conserves a man in the good right up to the end of his life.” (Part 2-2, q137, a4, resp) For “it has been granted to those predestined by the grace of Christ not only *to be able to persevere,* but also *to actually persevere*. Hence, the first man, whom no man was threatening and yet used his free will against the rule of a threatening God, did not remain in his great happiness, along with his great facility not to sin. But those \[who have been predestined], even as the world rages against their persevering, have persevered in the Faith.” (Part 2-2, q137, a4, repl obj 2)

A degenerate of the virtue of [[Courage (vm)|courage]].

**Perseverance is a potential part of constancy:** “[constancy](**Perseverance is a potential part of constancy:** “constancy can pertain to [[Perseverance (f)|perseverance]], since one is said to persevere in light of the fact that he does not stop because of how long things are taking (*propter diuturnitatem*), whereas one is said to be constant in light of the fact that he does not stop because of any other sort of obstacle.” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, rep obj 6)) can pertain to perseverance, since one is said to persevere in light of the fact that he does not stop because of how long things are taking (*propter diuturnitatem*), whereas one is said to be constant in light of the fact that he does not stop because of any other sort of obstacle.” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, rep obj 6)

**Link to every virtue (!):** “Insofar as *perseverance* implies continuing a good work to the very end, it can be a circumstance of every virtue. However, it is posited as a part of fortitude in the sense that has been explained.” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, repl obj 5)

Reasoning strictly in parallel with the case of patience (amidst an absence of any remarks about perseverance in the relevant articles), it should have the same underlying disposition as the homonymous fruit of [[Perseverance (f)|perseverance]], which merely has added to it the attribute of delight: “As was explained above (*ST* 1-2, q. 11, a. 1 and q. 70, a. 1), by its nature ‘fruit’ implies a certain sort of delight. But as *Ethics* 1 points out, “The operations of the virtues are delightful in themselves.” Now it is common for the name ‘virtues’ to signify the *acts* of the virtues as well. And so patience, as regards the *habit*, is posited as a virtue with respect to the delight that it has in its act, whereas it is posited as a *fruit* mainly because it is through patience that one’s mind is preserved from being overwhelmed by sadness” (Part 2-2, q136, a1, repl obj 3)
$\qquad$As such, I’ve connected perseverance (f) to courage via the virtue of perseverance, not directly.

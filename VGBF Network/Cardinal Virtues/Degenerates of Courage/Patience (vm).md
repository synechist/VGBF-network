A degenerate of the virtue of [[Courage (vm)|courage]], where in its breadth of meaning it is a potential part, but concerning narrowly the preparation of the mind for enduring, and involving the risk of death, it is an integral part.

Same underlying disposition as the homonymous fruit of [[Patience (f)|patience]], which merely has added to it the attribute of delight: “it is common for the name ‘virtues’ to signify the acts of the virtues as well. And so patience, as regards the habit, is posited as a virtue with respect to the delight that it has in its act, whereas it is posited as a fruit mainly because it is through patience that one’s mind is preserved from being overwhelmed by sadness.” (Part 2-2, q136, a1, repl obj 3)

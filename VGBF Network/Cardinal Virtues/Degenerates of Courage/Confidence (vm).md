Confidence (vm) (*Fiducia*) (vm): “that by which the mind has set up within itself a lot of confidence, along with hope, with respect to great and upright undertakings” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, resp)


## Network
**Connection to hope:** confidence is inspired by [hope](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FTheological%20Virtues%2FHope%20(vt)) affirmed by knowledge of a given situation.
$\qquad$Qualifier: “the hope by which one has confidence in God (*de Deo confidit*) is posited as a theological virtue. By contrast, through the confidence which is now being posited as a part of fortitude a man has hope in himself, though as subordinated to God (*tamen sub Deo*).” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, repl obj 2) I cautiously read “hope in oneself” as derived from the theological virtue of hope, and no less infused as the rest of the network. As such, I connect confidence to hope, for where else in the VGBF network would infused hope in oneself come from?

**An integral part of [[Courage (vm)|courage]]:** “confidence implies a certain mode of hope, since confidence is hope that has been strengthened by a firm opinion. Now a mode applied to an affection can be relevant to the commendation of the act, in the sense that the act is thereby meritorious without thereby being determined to a species of virtue; rather, the species comes from the subject matter. And so ‘confidence’ cannot, properly speaking, be the name of a virtue, though it can be the name of a condition that belongs to a virtue. And it is on this score that confidence is counted as a part of fortitude—not in the sense that it is a virtue adjoined to fortitude (except insofar as *confidence* is taken for *magnanimity* in the manner of Tully), but in the sense, explained above (q. 128), that it is like an *integral part*.” (Part 2-2, q129, a6, repl obj 3).

**Confidence is an integral part of [[Magnanimity (vm)|magnanimity]]**: “one can say that confidence pertains to the certitude of the hope, whereas magnanimity pertains to the greatness of the thing hoped for.” (Part 2-2, q128, a1 repl obj 6)”
$\qquad$“confidence implies a certain mode of hope, since confidence is hope that has been strengthened by a firm opinion” (Part 2-2, q129, a6, resp obj 3). Now “magnanimity has to do properly with the hope for something arduous. And so, since confidence implies a strength of hope that derives from a thought which effects a strong opinion about pursuing a good, it follows that confidence belongs to magnanimity.” (Part 2-2, q129, a6, resp)
$\qquad$”*hope* (*spes*) is directly opposed to *despair* (*desperatio*), which has the same object, viz. the good. On the other hand, if we assume contrariety among the objects, then hope is opposed to *fear*, which has the bad as its object. Now confidence implies a sort of strength of hope. And so it is opposed to fear in the same way that hope is. But because fortitude properly speaking strengthens a man against evils, whereas magnanimity strengthens him in the pursuit of honor, it follows that confidence belongs more properly to magnanimity than to fortitude. On the other hand, since hope is a cause of daring, which belongs to fortitude, it follows that confidence belongs to fortitude in the manner of a consequence.” (Part 2-2, q129, a6, repl obj 2)

Prudence (v): “knowing the next step to take”. Practical wisdom “that disposes practical reason to discern our true good in every circumstance and to choose the right means of achieving it (Catechism of the Catholic Church, n. 1806) to reach the true fulfilment of our lives. Prudence is therefore the virtue that steers the moral virtues, like the rudder of a ship.” (_Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance_, p. 16).  
$\qquad$”Now [making (*facere*)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FIntellectual%20virtues%2FArt%20(vi)) and doing (*agere*) differ from one another in the sense that, as Metaphysics 9 says, making (*factio*) is a transient act on an exterior matter, e.g., building, cutting, etc., whereas doing (*agere*) is an act that remains within the agent himself, e.g., seeing, willing, etc. So, then, prudence is related to human acts of this latter sort, which are the use of powers and habits, in the same way that [art](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FIntellectual%20virtues%2FArt%20(vi)) is related to exterior makings, since both are reason perfected with respect to the things to which they are related” (Part 1-2, q57, a4, resp)
$\qquad$**An intellectual virtue accompanied by an upright appetite:** ”what is required for prudence, which is right reason with respect to what can be done, is that the man be well-disposed with respect to the ends, and this is effected by an upright appetite.” (Part 1-2, q57, a4, resp)
$\qquad$”a craftsman who makes a mistake on purpose (*volens peccat*) is praised more than a craftsman who makes a mistake unwittingly (*nolens peccat*). By contrast, it is more contrary to prudence for someone to sin wittingly rather than unwittingly (magis contra *prudentiam quod aliquis peccat volens quam nolens*). For uprightness of will is part of the nature of prudence, but not part of the nature of an [art](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FIntellectual%20virtues%2FArt%20(vi)) (*est de ratione prudentiae, non autem de ratione artis*).” (Part 1-2, q57, a4, resp)

(a) Radical difference in goal from classical prudence: “the goal of a Christian life is transformed from the concept of the good life in pagan society, even in its most refined form. The goal of a Christian life is heaven, which is the home of those who love God” (_Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance_, p. 18).  

(b) Natural inadequacy to exercise prudence is given supernaturally: “As noted previously, however, loving God in a second-person sense, culminating in friendship, is not natural to human beings but is only possible by grace. Given that we ourselves need to be formed for heaven by means of a response to grace, we cannot conceive of what heaven means in advance” (_Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance_, p. 18).  

(c) Characterised by a child-like trust: “Much of what it means to be prudent in the Christian life therefore involves having an essentially child-like trust in God, so that we are led safely along a path for our lives that we would not choose for ourselves” (_Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance_, p. 18.)  

(d) Given instantly and rewrites the script of one’s life: "once grace and its associated gifts have been received, they are certain to bring us to heaven and cannot be taken away, provided we do not cast them away ourselves by mortal sin” (_Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance_, p. 18).

**Distinction from art**: “[art](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FIntellectual%20virtues%2FArt%20(vi)) is right reason with respect to what can be *made* (*recta ratio factibilium*), whereas prudence is right reason with respect to what can be *done* (*recta ratio agibilium*).” (Part 2-2, q57, a4, resp)
## Network
**Connection to [love](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FTheological%20Virtues%2FLove%20(v)):** “the right reason that belongs to prudence requires much more that a man be related in the right way to his ultimate end—a relation that is effected by charity—than that he be related in the right way to other ends—a relation that is effected by the moral virtues—just as right reason in speculative matters especially requires the first indemonstrable principle, viz., that contradictories are not simultaneously true. Hence, it is clear that infused prudence cannot exist without charity and, as a result, neither can the other moral virtues, which cannot exist without prudence.” (Part 1-2, q65, a2, resp)

Since prudence is knowing the next step to take, **I initially inferred** that it is connected to all the cognitive gifts:
- [Counsel](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FCounsel%20(g))
- [Knowledge](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FKnowledge%20(g)%20(b))
- [Understanding](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FUnderstanding%20(g))
- [Wisdom](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FWisdom%20(g))
However, Pinsent observes that the gift of [counsel](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FCounsel%20(g)%20Mercy%20(b)%20(v)) is ”Appended to the virtue of prudence” (_Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit_, screen 6). This appears, in (Part 2-2, q52, a1, repl to obj 2 and a4, response), to be due to their both being *directly* about practical action, whereas knowledge, understanding, and wisdom are speculative. Therefore

I connect the intellectual virtues together as follows:
1. [Wisdom (vi)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FIntellectual%20virtues%2FWisdom%20(vi))
2. [Understanding (g) (b) (vi) (vm)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FUnderstanding%20(g)%20(b)%20(vi)%20(vm))
3. [Scientific knowledge](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FIntellectual%20virtues%2FScientific%20knowledge%20(vi))
4. [Art](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FIntellectual%20virtues%2FArt%20(vi))
5. Prudence
**Rationale:** by a “certain ordering” in which “one part is more perfect than another”… scientific knowledge depends on understanding as on what is more important… and both of them depend on wisdom as on that which is most important … and which contains under itself” the others, “insofar as it passes judgment both on the conclusions of the types of scientific knowledge and on the principles of those same types” that is, on matters pertaining to understanding. (Part 1-2 q57, a2 reply to obj 2)
$\qquad$Furthermore, art takes the output of the speculative intellectual virtues and applies it to the craft of a thing. And then prudence makes use or orders art toward right action.

**Scope of interconnectedness of prudence to the moral virtues:** “the entire subject matter of the moral virtues falls under the unified consideration of prudence” (Part 1-2, q65, repl obj 3)

### Degenerates
Aquinas gives twenty “parts” of prudence, in three divisions.

**Relation between prudence, the integral parts, and the subjective parts:** “Memory, understanding, and foresight—and, likewise, caution, docility and other things of this sort—are not virtues distinct from prudence, but are in some sense related to prudence as *integral parts*, insofar as they are all required for the perfection of prudence. There are also certain *subjective parts*, or *species*, of prudence, e.g., economic prudence, kingly prudence, etc. But the three virtues under discussion here are, as it were, *potential parts* of prudence, since they are ordered toward prudence in the way that what is secondary is related to what is principal. More will be said about this below (ST 2-2, qq. 48ff.)” (Part 1-2, q57, a6, rep to obj 4)

*Integral* parts are indicated on the map by the direction of their arrows toward prudence.
*Potential* parts are indicated by arrows in the opposite direction to those of the integral parts, since integral parts together form a virtue, while potential parts extend a virtue to some other less-difficult context, adding something new to the virtue in order to extend it:

I. *Integral parts*, in the way that the walls, roof, and foundation are parts of a house”; “the parts of the virtue are the things that must come together for a complete or perfect act of that virtue” (Part 2-2, q48, a1 response)
I.i. *Cognitive integral parts:*
1. [memory](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Prudence%2FMemory%20(vm)) (*memoria*) – “for cognition about things that are past”
2. [understanding](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FUnderstanding%20(g)%20(vi)%20(vm)%20Purity%20(b))  (*intellectus*) – for cognition about things that are present
3. [reasoning](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Prudence%2FReasoning%20(vm)) (*ratio*) – how one uses a cognition in relation to what else is known, in order to have cognition of, or to judge, other things.
4. [docility](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Prudence%2FDocility%20(vm)) (*docilitas*) – for cognition of things through teaching
5. [quick-wittedness](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Prudence%2FQuick-wittedness%20(vm)) or shrewdness (*eustochia sive solertia*) – for cognition in the discovery of things
I.ii. *Commands* by which the cognition is applied to action:
6. [foresight](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Prudence%2FForesight%20(vm)) (*providentia*) – to command something appropriate to the end, so as to give correct commands
7. [circumspection](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Prudence%2FCircumspection%20(vm)) (*circumspectio*) – to pay attention to the circumstances of the matter at hand, so as to give correct commands
8. [caution](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Prudence%2FCaution%20(vm)) (*cautio*) – to avoid obstacles, so as to give correct commands 

II. *Subjective parts*, as in subjects contracted to prudence; the *species* of prudence:
9. prudence by which one governs himself (*regit seipsum*)
10. prudence by which one governs a multitude (regit multitudinem)
	1. Military prudence (prudentia militaris)
	2. Economic prudence (pertaining to multitudes united for the whole of life, like a family)
	3. Kingly prudence (pertaining to the ruler of a multitude of a city or kingdom)
	4. Political prudence (pertaining the ruler’s subjects)

	II.i. *Prudence taken so broadly as to include even speculative science,* then “in accord with the three modes of proceeding in the sciences,” there is:
	1. dialectical prudence: for fashioning opinions from what is more probable
	2. rhetorical prudence: for inducing impressions (*suspiciones)* from conjectures or for persuading in some way
	3. physical prudence: for effecting scientific knowledge through demonstration

IV. *Potential parts*, that is, “adjoining virtues that are ordered toward certain secondary acts or subject matters—not having, as it were, the full power of the principal virtue”. (“By contrast, prudence has to do with the principal act, which is to command”):
11. [[Good deliberation (vm)|good deliberation]] (*euboulia*), “which has to do with deliberating” and enquiry.
12. [[Good common judgment (vm)|good common judgment]] (*synesis*), “which has to do with situations that commonly occur”
13. [[Epieikeia (vm)|good particular judgment]] (*gnome*), or good sense, “which has to do with situations in which one must depart from the common law”

**Important note on the classification of the above virtues:** “all these things are posited as parts of prudence not in all their generality but according to the relation they have to the thing that pertain to prudence” (Part 2-2, q48, a1, rep obj 3)
$\qquad$That is, **they could pertain to other virtues, gifts, beatitudes, fruits or other kinds of act.**

Continence (*Continentia*) (vm): “a movement of the will …that controls \[the force of a passion] in such a way that even though the man feels immoderate passions, the will is nonetheless not conquered”
$\qquad$Either the curbing of lawful sense desires, or not being led astray by them. (Part 1-2, q70, a3, resp)
$\qquad$Conjugal continence: first degree of virtue, signified by the thirtyfold unit in Matthew 13:23
$\qquad$The continence of widows: second degree of virtue, signified by the thirtyfold unit in Matthew 13:23
$\qquad$Virginal continence: third degree of virtue, signified by the thirtyfold unit in Matthew 13:23 (Part 1-2, q70, a3, rep obj 2)

“in Ethics 4, the Philosopher says, “Continence is not a virtue but a sort of mixture,” viz., insofar as it has something that belongs to virtue and yet falls short of virtue in a certain respect.” (Part 2-2, q155, a1, response)

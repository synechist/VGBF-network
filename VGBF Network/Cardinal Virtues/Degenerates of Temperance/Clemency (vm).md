[[Clemency (vm)]] (*Clementia*) (vm): the disposition that “moderates the exterior act of punishing” (Part 2-2, q157, a1, resp)

 “Now clemency and [gentleness](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FFruits%2FMeekness%20(vd)%20(b)%20(f)) likewise consist in a certain sort of restraint, since, as is clear from what has been said (aa. 1-2), clemency limits punishments, whereas gentleness mitigates anger. And this is why both clemency and gentleness are adjoined to [temperance](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FTemperance%20(v)) as to a principal virtue. And accordingly they are posited as parts of temperance.” (Part 2-2, Q 157, a3, response)
$\qquad$”they differ from one another, in that clemency moderates the exterior act of punishing, whereas gentleness properly diminishes the passion of anger.” (Part 2-2, q157, a1, resp)

Abstinence (*Abstinentia*) (vm): temperance “with respect to food and drink” (Part 2-2, q143, a1, resp)

“as Ethics 10 explains, pleasures are proportioned to the operations of which the pleasures are the fulfillment. But it is clear that the operations involving the use of food, by which the nature of the individual is preserved, belong to a different species from the operations involving the use of the sexual organs, by which the nature of the species is preserved. And so chastity, which has to do with sexual pleasure, is a virtue distinct from abstinence, which has to do with the pleasures of food.”

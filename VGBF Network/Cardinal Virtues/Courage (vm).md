Courage (*Fortitudo*) (vm): “to act well in the face of opposition” (*Faith, Hope and Love*, p. 15); “‘the moral virtue that ensures firmness in difficulties and constancy in the pursuit of the good.’ (Catechism of the Catholic Church, n. 1808)” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 35).
$\qquad$”Remove\[s] obstacles that hinder our wills from following the path of right reason” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 35).
$\qquad$"courage operates principally against intimidations; temperance operates principally against temptations” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 35).
$\qquad$”associated with the gift of the Holy Spirit that bears the same name” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 38).
$\qquad$”like justice, the fourth beatitude is especially associated with courage \[…] but all the beatitudes, to some extent, articulate this virtue” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 38-39).

## Acquisition:
“In the Christian life of grace, the virtues are united by the supernatural virtue of divine love, a context in which courage and sacrifice are closely intertwined. Someone who truly loves is prepared to sacrifice, and even to give his or her life for the sake of the beloved. Courageous actions associated with such love do not have to be rehearsed by repeated actions, and even young, relatively untrained Christians have given their lives for Christ.” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 40).
$\qquad$”The virtue of courage, mysterious in classical philosophy, finds its true home and meaning in the Christian life” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 41).
$\qquad$"associated with the \[virtue] that bears the same name” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 38).”
$\qquad$Disordered if not arising from love: “Ultimately, courage accompanies the theological virtue of love, and it is only with the virtue of love that a sacrifice, like that of St Paul, is supernaturally fruitful” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 41).


## Network
Insofar as courage is a specific virtue, it does not have *specific* parts because it has a very specific subject matter and so cannot be divided into many virtues differing in species. (Part 2-2, q128, a1, resp)

“*Integral* parts \[are parts] according to the things that have to come together for an act of fortitude”

“*Potential* parts \[pertain to] what fortitude attends to \[outside of its principal subject matter, that is] in the case of the most difficult hardship, viz. the danger of death. certain other virtues \[are present] in the case of less difficult subject matters. These virtues are adjoined as secondary virtues to the principal virtue.”

**Circularity warning:** 
![[Pasted image 20240501221126.png]]
1. **Redundancy:** Some secondary virtues/potential parts of courage rely on *both* courage *and* one or more of courage’s integral parts. This is like saying that to build a table you’d need a tree and also a branch of that tree.
	$\qquad$For example, magnanimity is a potential part of courage, and security confidence is an integral part of courage. But confidence is also an integral part of magnanimity! That is, courage already implies confidence, so it’s redundant to say that confidence is an integral part of magnanimity.
2. **Circularity** Some integral parts of courage *both* partially constitute courage *and* are constituted by a secondary virtue/potential part. This is like saying that to build a table you’d need the heartwood and also another bit of heartwood that’s been sanded and sealed.
	$\qquad$For example, security is a potential part of courage, and confidence is an integral part of courage. But security is also an integral part of confidence! That is, security is an integral part of an integral part of courage. Therefore, *security should not be a potential part*.
	$\qquad$The same is true for constancy, in relation to *both* perseverance and magnificence, and for strenuousness, in relation to magnificence.


## Degenerates
Integral parts *or* potential parts, that is, secondary virtues, depending on whether the situation is one involving danger of death or “other subject matters in which there is less difficulty” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, resp). 
$\qquad$The virtues in this section are modelled as integral parts, which is indicated on the map by the direction of their arrows toward Courage. The integral parts, however, can each be potential parts, and are also involved in various other potential parts.:
	For the act of attacking:
		Preparation of the mind:
			[Confidence](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Courage%2FConfidence%20(vm)) (*Fiducia*) (vm): “that by which the mind has set up within itself a lot of confidence, along with hope, with respect to great and upright undertakings” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, resp)
		Execution of the deed:
			[Magnificence](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Courage%2FMagnificence%20(vm)) (*Magnificentia*) (vm): “‘to do with thinking about and managing’—i.e. executing–’great and lofty undertakings, with a capacious and noble purpose of mind’—so that management is not lacking for one’s capacious plans.” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, resp)
	For the act of enduring:
		Preparation of the mind:
			[Patience](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Courage%2FPatience%20(vm)) (*Patientia*) (vm): “the voluntary and prolonged endurance of arduous and difficult things for the sake of uprightness and usefulness.” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, resp)
		Execution of the deed:
			[Perseverance](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Courage%2FPerseverance%20(vm)) (*Perseverantia*) (vm): “the stable and continued persistence in a well thought out purpose.” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, resp) 
		
Potential parts (indicated by arrows in the opposite direction to those of the integral parts, since integral parts together form a virtue, while potential parts extend a virtue to some other less-difficult context, adding something new to the virtue in order to extend it:
	To do with great honour:
		[[Magnanimity (vm)]]:“the disposition to undertake great acts of any kind, the achievement of which are worthy of the highest honours” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 37).
	To do with driving out fear:
		[[Security (vm)]]: bolsters against fear, the contrary of hope (“which cannot exist unless \[its] contrary is removed” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, repl obj 6)) and thus works alongside [hope](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FTheological%20Virtues%2FHope%20(vt)) to support [confidence](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Courage%2FConfidence%20(vm).
	To do with not wavering in general:
		[[Constancy (vm)]]: “not stopping because of any …obstacle \[other than how long things are taking].” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, rep obj 6)
	To do with doing great works with virility:
		[[Strenuousness (vm)|Strenuousness]] (*Strenuitas*) (vm): to “carry out \[great works] with a virile prudence and care.” (Part 2-2, q128, a1, repl ojb 6)

“The associated fruits of the Spirit are [patience](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Courage%2FPatience%20(vm)) and [perseverance](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Courage%2FPerseverance%20(vm)), and the life of grace to which they belong sheds light on the problems of courage that were mysterious in the classical world” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 39).

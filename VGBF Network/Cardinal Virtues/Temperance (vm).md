Temperance (v): virtue respecting food and drink (*Faith, Hope and Love*, p. 15)
$\qquad$”Remove\[s] obstacles that hinder our wills from following the path of right reason” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 35).
$\qquad$”the task of temperance is to help prevent us from being drawn away by disordered pleasure” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 35).
$\qquad$"courage operates principally against intimidations; temperance operates principally against temptations” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 35).
$\qquad$”we need to kill off the “life according to the flesh”, which is not to say that our bodies need to be killed, although we shall die at some point, but rather that the ordinary pattern of a life in this world without grace has to perish, a process called mortification” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 48).
$\qquad$The end to which we should be ordered, rather than being trapped in disordered (intemperate) desires, is “liturgical”: “We are not just *homo sapiens,* meaning ‘knowing’, ‘wise’ or ‘tasting’ man, but also *homo liturgicus*. Christian liturgy helps to form all the many temperate qualities. The Liturgy of the Hours helps to order the day in a regular manner. The liturgical calendar includes feast days and fast days, giving opportunities for mortification. The Mass, especially when offered in a dignified and holy way, forms a sense of reverence generally. But in addition, the communion of Christ and His Church is also the prototype for the sacramental meaning of the joy and sacrifice of husband and wife in Christian marriage. Liturgy should teach the priest to act more perfectly in the person of Christ, strengthen the reverence of husbands and wives for one another, and help all of us to cultivate a temperance that is not mere moderation, in the ordinary sense, but Christian holiness.” (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 50-51.)
$\qquad$Because temperance operates against temptations, which lure a person in, its nature is elaborated upon in terms of the varieties of lure, that is, its corresponding vices.

## Particular examples of the vices of intemperance
Eating and drinking (typically pertaining to greed):
	Excess: consuming too much
	Deficiency: consuming too little
	Bolting food
	Eating rudely
	Excessive delicacy in fine foods
	Eating at irregular times, in response to transient urges (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 46).
Sexuality (typically pertaining to lust):
	adultery (CCC 2380), 
	contraception (CCC 2370), 
	divorce (CCC 2382), 
	fornication (CCC 2353), 
	homosexual practices (CCC 2357), 
	masturbation (CCC 2352), 
	pornography (CCC 2355), 
	prostitution (CCC 2355) 
	rape (CCC 2356). 
	the deliberate indulgence of thoughts of sexual sin (*Prudence, Justice, Courage, and Temperance*, p. 46).
	\[And, presumably, having sex too little, or deficient sex!]
	
## Network
Since temperance concerns the ordering of appetites or desires, not the ordering of the mind, **I infer** that it is connected to the appetitive gifts:

### Connection to friendliness
[Friendliness (vm)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Justice%2FFriendliness%20(vm)) is connected with the fruit of [peace (f)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FFruits%2FPeace%20(f)), which is not only a fruit of the cognitive gifts (which connected with justice and others) but also of the appetitive gifts. **I infer** therefore that [[Friendliness (vm)]] is connected via the virtue of temperance, or else one would quickly fail to be friendly as soon as some intemperate desire arose (e.g. hangriness).

Faith (v): “the infused supernatural virtue of grasping and assenting to supernatural truths” (_Faith, Hope and Love_, p. 42).  

(a) “the ‘guardian of [love](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FTheological%20Virtues%2FLove%20(v))”. Specifically, faith is the virtue of grasping with the mind and assenting to what God has revealed in the present world, over and above what is known by unaided natural reason” (_Faith, Hope and Love_, p. 41), because “although we can examine the world to know that there is a God, which is what pre-Christian philosophers like Aristotle tell us, the world is not enough to know God personally, let alone to be friends with God in love” (_Faith, Hope and Love_, p. 40). Cf. the Nicene Creed, which “do not contain anything that could be known by the human mind without special divine action in the world” (_Faith, Hope and Love_, p. 42).  

(b) “believing in God revealed  

(c) “believing in what God reveals  

(d) “believing _in_ \[i.e. through] God, in the sense of being moved by God the Holy Spirit to spiritual understanding” (_Faith, Hope and Love_, p. 41).

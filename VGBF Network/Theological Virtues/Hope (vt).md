Hope (v): a disposition to expect to climb a sort of ladder from an initially more passive, lowly and undesirable position to one of exercising second-personal divine love.  

(a) “hope is principally about God and the future goods of heaven for one’s own sake, and **is therefore first-personal**.(_Faith, Hope and Love_, p. 47)

(b) “Unlike divine love, hope ceases in the kingdom of heaven because all these good things have then been obtained, whereas the ecstatic fruition of the divine love of God is everlasting.” (_Faith, Hope and Love_, p. 47).  

(c) “The Christian life \[…] gradually becomes more ecstatic and outward-focused, as the exercise of the virtue of hope gradually enables and gives way to the practice of divine [[Love (vt)|love]]” (_Faith, Hope and Love_, p. 51).

**Connection to the theological virtues:** “An interlinear Gloss on Matthew 1:2 says, ‘[Faith](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FTheological%20Virtues%2FFaith%20(v)) generates hope, whereas hope generates [[Love (vt)|charity]].’ But what generates is prior to what is generated and can exist without it. Therefore, faith can exist without hope, and hope can exist without charity.” (Part 1-2, q65, resp)

The gift of [[Fear (g) Poor in Spirit (b)|fear]] is ”Appended to the virtue of hope” (_Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit_, screen 6).
$\qquad$I understand the **rationale** of this connection to be “hoping to be better able to be one with God, therefore fearing the loss of this and other goods glimpsed at.”


**Connection to confidence:** [[Confidence (vm)|confidence (vm)]] is inspired by hope affirmed by knowledge of a given situation.

(a) The beatitudes are connected to hope, since they are “micro-narratives” which link an undesirable state with a promised future state (*Faith, Hope and Love*, p. 50). Thus:
- [First beatitude (b)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FBeatitudes%2FFirst%20beatitude%20(b))
- [Knowledge (g) (b)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FKnowledge%20(g)%20(b))
- [Meekness (vd) (b) (f)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FFruits%2FMeekness%20(vd)%20(b)%20(f))
- [Courage (g) (b)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FCourage%20(g)%20(b))
- [Fifth beatitude (b)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FBeatitudes%2FFifth%20beatitude%20(b))
- [Understanding (g) (b)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FUnderstanding%20(g)%20(b))
- [Seventh beatitude (b)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FBeatitudes%2FSeventh%20beatitude%20(b))

(b) The beatitudes exhibit a shift from (i) more passive states, such as mourning and meekness, to more active states like exercising mercy and making peace; (ii) a shift from first-personal need (e.g. “poor in spirit”) to a focus on other persons and a “care and outpouring of love for other persons”. “The Christian life \[…] gradually becomes more ecstatic and outward-focused, as the exercise of the virtue of hope gradually enables and gives way to the practice of [divine love](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FTheological%20Virtues%2FLove%20(v))” (*Faith, Hope and Love*, p. 51).

Love (v)
	(a) “involve\[s] a desire for union, communion, or friendship with the \[beloved]‘’ (_Faith, Hope and Love_, p. 33).
	(b) “has \[an] _ecstatic_ quality that takes us out of ourselves, namely a desire for the good of the \[beloved] as if from that person’s perspective” (_Faith, Hope and Love_, p. 33).  
	(c) is interpersonal ((_Faith, Hope and Love_, p. 30)  

The originary virtue or meta-disposition? – ”whoever has _caritas_, which unites us to God, has all the Gifts, none of which can be possessed without _caritas_[^1]

Looking at how [Peace (f)] connects to all the gifts via justice and temperance, it appears that all the gifts are appended to love.
$\qquad$For simplicity, unless any gift is specifically linked to a different theological virtue, they will be linked to love.

Pinsent observes that the gift of [[Wisdom (g) (vi) Peace (b)|wisdom]] is ”Appended to the virtue of love (caritas)” (_Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit_, screen 6). Whether this is in some special sense, over and above the other gifts, remains to be seen.

**Connection to [prudence] \[by way of the gifts and the beatitudes, judging by the sections on these dispositions]:** “the right reason that belongs to prudence requires much more that a man be related in the right way to his ultimate end—a relation that is effected by charity—than that he be related in the right way to other ends—a relation that is effected by the moral virtues—just as right reason in speculative matters especially requires the first indemonstrable principle, viz., that contradictories are not simultaneously true. Hence, it is clear that infused prudence cannot exist without charity and, as a result, neither can the other moral virtues, which cannot exist without prudence.” (Part 1-2, q65, a2, resp)”

(b) The beatitudes exhibit a shift from (i) more passive states, such as mourning and meekness, to more active states like exercising mercy and making peace; (ii) a shift from first-personal need (e.g. “poor in spirit”) to a focus on other persons and a “care and outpouring of love for other persons”. “The Christian life \[…] gradually becomes more ecstatic and outward-focused, as the exercise of the virtue of hope gradually enables and gives way to the practice of [divine love]” (*Faith, Hope and Love*, p. 51).

Presumably connected to [[Love (f)|love (f)]].
Also connected to [[Joy (f)|joy (f)]]:
$\qquad$“Joy necessarily follows upon the love of charity. For every love rejoices at being joined to what he loves. \[And] charity always has God, whom it loves, present. Hence, what follows from charity is *joy* (*gaudium*).” (Part 1-2, q70, a3, resp)

Art (vi) (*ars*): the intellectual virtue of “right reason concerning certain works to be made (*ratio recta aliquorum operum faciendorum*)” (Part 2-2, q57, a3, resp)

**Distinction from practical/moral virtues:** “art is, properly speaking, a habit directed toward a work (*habitus operativus*); and yet an art shares something in common with the speculative habits, since it is likewise relevant to the speculative habits themselves how it stands with the things which they are considering and not how the human appetite is disposed toward those things. For when a geometer is demonstrating a truth, it does not matter what the condition of the appetitive part of his soul is (*non refert qualiter se habeat secundum appetitivam partem*), e.g., whether he is cheerful or angry—in the same way that, as has been explained, this does not matter in the case of the craftsman. 
$\qquad$”And so an art has the character of a virtue in the same way that a speculative habit does. More specifically, an art or a speculative habit makes a work good only as regards the facility for acting well and not as regards use, which is what is proper to a virtue that perfects the appetite.” (Part 2-2, q57, a3, resp)

$\qquad$**Pushing this distinction on the subject of the art of intellection:** “Even in the case of the objects of the speculative intellect themselves (*etiam in ipsis speculabilibus*) there is something in the manner of a work, e.g., the construction of a syllogism or of an appropriate expression, or a work of enumerating or measuring. And so any speculative habits that are ordered toward these sorts of works of reason are called ‘arts’ because of a certain similarity— though they are called ‘liberal arts’ (*artes liberales*) in order to differentiate them from those arts which are ordered toward works exercised through the body and which are in some sense ‘servile’ arts, insofar as the body is subject as a servant to the soul, and insofar as a man is free (*liber*) because of the soul. By contrast, those types of scientific knowledge that are not ordered toward any work of this sort are called scientific knowledge absolutely speaking and not arts (*scientiae simpliciter, non autem artes*).”

**Distinction from prudence**: “art is right reason with respect to what can be made (*recta ratio factibilium*), whereas prudence is right reason with respect to what can be done (*recta ratio agibilium*).” (Part 2-2, q57, a4, resp)

## Network
I connect the intellectual virtues together as follows:
1. [Wisdom](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FIntellectual%20virtues%2FWisdom%20(vi))
2. [Understanding](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FGifts%2FUnderstanding%20(g)%20(b)%20(vi)%20(vm))
3. [Scientific knowledge](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FIntellectual%20virtues%2FScientific%20knowledge%20(vi))
4. Art
5. [[Prudence (vi)]]
**Rationale:** by a “certain ordering” in which “one part is more perfect than another”… scientific knowledge depends on understanding as on what is more important… and both of them depend on wisdom as on that which is most important … and which contains under itself” the others, “insofar as it passes judgment both on the conclusions of the types of scientific knowledge and on the principles of those same types” that is, on matters pertaining to understanding. (Part 1-2 q57, a2 reply to obj 2)
$\qquad$Furthermore, art takes the output of the speculative intellectual virtues and applies it to the craft of a thing. And then prudence makes use or orders art toward right action.

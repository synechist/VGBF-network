Lying (vice) (*Mendacium*): “falsehood about objects of implicit or explicit joint attention” (The Non-Aristotelian Virtue of Hope, p. 98)
$\qquad$**Intentionally stating what is false (even if it’s unintentionally true):** “And so if someone states what is false while believing that it is true, then there is, to be sure, something false *materially speaking*, but not *formally speaking*, since the falsity lies outside the speaker’s intention. Hence, it does not have the complete nature of lying, since what lies outside one’s intention is incidental (*per accidens*) and so cannot be a specific difference. By contrast, if someone *formally speaking* states what is false, i.e., if he has the intention of stating what is false, then even if what is stated is true, an act of this sort has falsity *per se* and truth *per accidens* to the extent that it is a voluntary and moral act. Hence, it attains to the species lying.” Part 2-2, q100, a1 resp)

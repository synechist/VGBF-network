Avarice (*Avaritia*) (vice): “an eager desire for metal coinage (aevis aviditas), since it consists in a desire for ‘monetary wealth’, by which all exterior goods can be understood.” (Part 2-2, q118, a1, obj1)

[Liberality](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FCardinal%20Virtues%2FDegenerates%20of%20Justice%2FLiberality%20(vm)) is the virtuous mean between the vices of avarice and [prodigality](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=Vices%2FVices%20of%20Injustice%2FVices%20of%20illiberality%2FProdigality%20(vice)).
$\qquad$Pinsent observes that Jesus’ liberality when he asks a disciple to catch a fish, out of the mouth of which comes a coin to pay tax to Caesar, illuminates how “a recollection of the larger context \[i.e. in which God our father gives us everything we need], with a touch of humour, may be helpful in breaking the spell \[of fear, anxiety associated with avarice].” (Pinsent, Avarice and Liberality, p.174) This same freedom, though, is distinguished from the “free” use of money exhibited in prodigality in that the freedom of liberality is fired by [love (vt)](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=VGBF%20Network%2FTheological%20Virtues%2FLove%20(vt)), with which we understand (through joint attention) the circumstances of others and liberally give what is needed for their good to be attained. That is, the distinction lies in the vices consisting in a shrinking into a first-person perspective, and the virtue acting upon a second-person perspective.
